Its reception was located in 4th floor, and separated lifts for going down to the mall and going upstairs to the rooms were there. Usual sized rooms with smart TV and ordinary clean toilet. Good but not exceptional. I have no complain for the bed tho. Battery in AC and TV remote were nearly worn out thus the remote was albeit unresponsive. View from 5th floor was bad (what you will see is only concrete rooftop). However all the staff was humble and helpful. I have to mention its proximity to cafes in Paskal 23 and Paskal Hypersquare tho since it had a really huge value for your consideration in choosing this hotel.","It was my second stay at Aryaduta. Everything was still amazing. The check-in process was easy and quick. I got a room on the 14th floor, with windows overlooking the city area, which was great. Just like the first stay, I booked a Business room and it was quite spacious, especially for one person. However, the room needed more thorough cleaning (especially the window) and it took longer to drain the bathtub.   The hotel's gym was not that big but it had everything I needed to exercise. The whirlpool made a perfect addition but I'd love it better if the water was warmer. The weather was bad so I didn't get to use the pool but I guess relaxing in the whirlpool was enough for me.

On arrival they tell me all sold out.  After voicing my displeasure  they magically found they had one. 2 I went to the lobby bar to get a quick drink. Smoking or non they said.  I chose non smoking. Pointless as people just smoked anywhere. At 5 am I got up to go to gym. I literally couldn't get in for 30 or 40 soldiers using it. Not one signed in if I had known it was a military facility i would have asked for a military price  This place should be avoided unless you are into military occupations

Positioned on top of Paskal 23, you can enjoy most of popular local food just below your room.  Try to keep up with other new hotels in Bandung, YELLO provides good ranges of amenities in their vicinity: game center and swimming pool are some of them.  Downside: no in-room fridge, the swimming pool is there just so it can claim to have a pool, you need to “fight” mall’s traffic to reach the hotel (especially Saturday’s night) since it has no dedicated lobby.",Being there for couples trip.

But the weird thing is that you’d expect glass-enclosed elevators moving up and down over the atrium bar. Instead, the elevators are hidden behind tasteful decorative fabric. The cars themselves seem undersized. What happened? I hear the property was built by a chain. The front desk staff thinks the elevators were built this way.   Other than the camouflaged elevators, the hotel is pleasant, comfortable, and clean. The decor is getting dated, but is okay. The floor lamp control is a pedal on the floor behind the lamp.

I enjoyed the front desk and all other service staff.    A couple of things that were disappointing:   The cleaning of the room was not done thoroughly.  The cleaning person did not replenish the soap, shampoo etc.  Have to call twice before they were delivered.  The breakfast buffet was adequate.  Could use more variety.  The service was good.  The buffet dinner, although priced fairly modestly, was very disappointing.  The food was not warm and hardly any choice.  The worst is that they actually charged 10% service charge for non-existing service for a buffet.  We had a la carte dinner another night and the quality was decent.

Those towels should not be distributed anymore for rooms, not for a four-star big hotel as Aryaduta. I was hoping to have white, soft and smell nice ones in my bathroom, and sadly there weren't any and I have to accept all the opposite of it.

Makes it a much better option to just stay in hotel and take a step back from your busy life."

Stayed here for two nights, I got a better deal when checked in Saturday and checked out on Monday. Location is quite far from downtown Bandung, since this hotel is situated in East side near Kiara Condong. Checking in here means, you eat, sleep and shop here. Basically everything is provided within the Trans complex. The beds, shower, and service are 'amazing'. Hotel employees are curteous and attentive. I give 4 stars instead of 5, bevause I am not impressed with the quality of breakfast. I might skip it next time and find local food in center of Bandung. "

The second morning we had our bf on the 18th floor, if I remember correctly, it was way quieter and the food is the same as what they serve downstairs.
