"I am glad we chose this visit besides the tangkuban perahu which had a fare hike for tourist. this place takes you about 3 hours away from the city of bandung. due the poor road system it was a boring and tiring journey but all worth it. upon reaching the shuttle bus station…","Entrance fee to the park is Rp. 300k per person which is expensive. Local rate is only Rp. 30k.  If you have money to waste go with a guided trekking tour to see Domas crater and get a foot massage in the hot spring. The tour will take more than 2 hours but when you pay at the…","","Repertoire quite well-designed. Amusing to watch the children who were pretty natural, seemed to be guileless and also enjoying themselves.

"Hate the smell but like the unique environment. Not something you see everyday. Might not be a good idea to bring children... If you do just make sure you bring mask for your children and yourself.","it is a beautiful sight. the place has less foul smell compared to kawah. do not go with the tour guides, touting for tour guides and items. it was annoying. but other than that, if you have a personal driver that you brought along, just ask him to tag along with you all the way.","","We visited Saung Angklung and were impressed by the rendition of little kids.
