"Fort Rotterdam is definitely one of the oldest and most intact forts in Indonesia. As such, it is certainly Makassar's premier historical site and we would recommend a visit here. The stone walls, Bone Bastion and Dutch-style buildings within the fort are all attractive and…","Many changes after 5 years, the place is amazing and beautiful for walking around, exercise in the morning sitting around and enjoy the views, very nice place for relax,","Our holiday in Taka Bonerate Marine National Park really one of the best experience for our family. We came for baby sharks and the atoll. And pak Agus our guide show us giant Kima, replanting coral area, and soft coral habitat.  Put on your sun glasses and sunblock, then enjoy the sun. Bring your personal medications just in case you stumble to naughty jellyfish, bring enough money to buy some fresh lobster. The nearest village is Rajuni island (and its don't have jetty).  Do not touch bright coral, some of it will burn your skin. And be careful when you feed baby shark, they are baby with sharp teeth <U+0001F605>. And sometimes there are baby stingray near the beach, watch your step.  We absolutely will come again.…","Bantimurung itself is a sample of over exploited nature attraction. Too much human interferes on the nature. Too many concrete constructions, paving blocks, etc. ","This is my 3rd time to go to this beach because this beach is simply so beautiful, you can find the clean white sands, blue sea water and and nice sky landscape, if you are go with tight budget, there is so many cheap hotels and inn around the entry"
"It is a very old place with some traditional cottages. We liked the museum most because of some ancient things like tools for agriculture purpose, traditional dress and miniature of wooden house , picture of kings, very old weapons used many many years back etc.But I do not…","I guess this place is good at night. Our hotel had great sunset views and views of the sea and mosque so we went here during the day..there's nothing there. Just a few statues and stuff. ","It is relatively easy to reach Taka Bonerate, comparing to other secluded/virgin beach or island in Indonesia. The snorkelling and diving site is still good.   The baby black tip shark is a delightful scenery in the morning. We got the front bungalow, meaning we could see the sunset while lounging at our terrace.…","Bantimurung National Park is located in Maros it’s about 2 hours from Makassar. You can enjoying the fresh air in here, exploring the cave, swimming in the waterfall and exploring the various type of butterflies and insects!   Also do not forget to buy souvenirs from locals.…","Bira have a very nice beach with white sand and sunshine.  You can see spectacular sunrise and sunset.  An excellent place to spent your holidays here."
"Interesting museum of Sulawesi history. Maintained very well. Informative with detailed write-up. Fairly large with multiple rooms. Cover the history from the Stone age up to the Dutch era","One of the busiest sightseeing location in Makassar.  Known by the locals a place to visit to see the sunset.  If you want to avoid the crowds come during day time.  It comes alive at night.  There are tons of restaurants, food stalls, and shops in the area.  You can spend 2-3…","We had a very long travel time to get here, it was a night of bus trip along with two hours of ferry boat trip and then a night of boat trip... well yess... imagine by your self. I spent two nights in this islands, took four logs of diving and stayed in Rajuni Village... All I can say is you'll be pleased with the underwater experience, it's the third biggest atoll in the world. Underwater visibility was clear... corals were amazing... met lots of exotic sea creatures. Well yess... all those time spent to get into this place was well paid. I suggest to take a plane to first get into Selayar and then get into Takabonerate by boat (I guess no better choice for this). …","Went to Batimurrung to see the waterfall today, but after seeing the crowded parking lot with dozens of tacky souvenir shops and knowing foreigners are gouged for a US$ 20 admission fee, we just turned around and left. I am sure it once was a nice natural attraction, but from…","We visited this beach on holiday. It was very crowded. This beach is the main destination for holiday or weekend in South Sulawesi. From Makassar took about 5 hours by car. At the beach there were some stalls which sale food and drink, souvenirs and we can take a rest there.…"
"It’s near our hotel. However we took a trip with becak tricycle for Rp 200.000 from the hotel to the harbour and the fort in the end. I forgot if there was a ticket but the staff in the hut asked for a donation. I was afraid it was ended in the pocket.  We walked through the…","When I visit this place is in the middle of the day and its crowded. The view was good. We can see beach, phinisi boat, and mosque with unique design. People say: you’re not officially come to Makassar if not visited Losari Beach.","I did snorkling at Taka Bonerate, it was very beautiful. We've been handled by the ranger of Taka Bonerate, They persuade us to try a discovery dive. I'm not pro in swimming, i still wear my life jacket while snorkling, so how could i dive? I said it to one of the rangers, but they were very helpful. They explained to us so patiently, informed us that we can see more beautiful views down there. Then me and my friend did it and it was for free.  Coral & fish are very various, i also saw a giant shell, local people call it with ""KIMA"". It take years to grow, i heard they only grow 2 centimeter in a year. So, I think this kima is very old, maybe hundreds year? I only bring a standard camera for underwater, But the truth is the underwater view is very amazing. Then the dive site is famous for the nudy branch, sometimes divers will choose to experience a night dive in Taka Bonerate.  I stayed at Tinabo Island. I admit it that the facilities are less enough for the tourist. You should take bath with salt water. If you are a backpacker, you won't be disturbed with this kind of situation. The electricity will be shut down at 12PM. I suggest you to sleep outside in hammock because our room ""nudy branch"" is very small, and the air circulation wasn't good enough. When i arrived there, a new facility was added, such as air condition but only in a large bungalow, and the electricity will be shut down at midnight. So, pointless i think.   Food not very various, mainly you will eat fish everyday. If your are from outside Indonesia, you need to beware of the chili. This is a special chili from Selayar Island, chili is very small but it will burnt your tounge. I bought this chili for my mom in Jakarta after we arrived at Selayar. Yes, most of Indonesian reallyyyyyyy loves chili.   Then, i also went to ""Tarupa Kecil Island"" to meet a local tribe, Bajo. These tribe is very famous, they live nomadically. They only stay at this island maybe 2-3 months then move to other island. When we arrived at Tarupa Kecil Island, our guide climbed the coconut tree and we enjoy the coconut fruit to relieve our thirst. We pay nothing for the coconut but our guide pay it to the local people.   Then i also visit sandbanks, called ""BUNGIN TINABO"". We could see a lot of seagulls in here but when we landed in these area, the seagulls flew away. We took some pictures and others only laid down on the beach.   Tips:  Be friendly to local people, they will be very happy to explain everything they know about Taka Bonerate. Actually, they only wants you to decide that Taka Bonerate is a good place to visit and maybe one day you will come back to Taka Bonerate for sure. I made a new friend there.  No internet connection, you need to change your network to 2G network. Only works for phone call in very limited time, we can't predict when the signal is strong/weak.…","I went there with my best friend and we found easily to get there simply by local angkot; but unfortunately it wasn’t me who arranged the transportation, it was her, so I don’t think I can share the details of the route how to get there from Makassar; one thing I recall is it…","Its okay, when we visit its during weekday so its quite empty. The area needs massive development, specially for hotels and food places."
"It was an interesting visit, mostly because its the only VOC fort still standing (or so we were told). There's a small museum that tells you a bit of the history. Another building that we wanted to visit, was closed. All in all, we stayed there for about half an hour.","Visited in the morning hours,  when the crowds were not present. Once there , one can see the most photographed sites of Makassar,  especially the lettering (City of Makassar, Losari etc).Tons of Kodak moments.  Just be aware that it can get very hot during the afternoon hours,…","We went to Taka Bonerate by plane from Makassar, South Sulawesi and stayed at the Tinobo island resort.  It was gorgeous!  Everyday, 24/7 we swam with 100s baby sharks mostly black and white tips.   The island is a small island which can be circled in 1 hour walk.  The resorts has several air conditioned (AC) rooms and can accommodate about 10-20 people.  It has camping facilities which accommodates more than 20 people.  The island does not have fresh water facilities other than rainwater storage and carted drinking water from neighboring islands.  Everything, including foodstuffs have to be brought in by boat.  Electricity runs from 6am till 00:00.  There is daily regular public boat that connects it to the surrounding islands and mainland Selayar.  At night, the milky-way is crystal clear and it is gorgeous!  We did snorkling and diving and were disappointed by the level of destruction to the (once) beautiful coral reefs and gardens.  There were visible signs of coral destroyed through fish bombings!    During out stay, we met with Indonesia sea police patrol officers who have just apprehended fish bombers and loads of explosives.  They also confiscated a boat.  Taka Bonerate is in dire need of help!  The fish bombing has to be stopped and for this the people of Selayar and Indonesian Government need help!    Please go and visit the Atol and voice your concerns on what you see.  Snorkling and diving in the mainland Selayar is gorgeous!  This is a separate review.…","Bantimurung has so many amazing places to visit. If you want to enjoy the olden times era, just come here and feel the historic moment. Leang Leang is one of Bantimurung squad. This place is very appropriate to with your friends, family, and youe couple too. The green view is…","It's worth if your final destination is snorkeling or island hopping to Pulau Kambing and Pulau Liukang Loe. If you are taking long hours ride from Makassar just to spend time on this beach, I would not recommend because you have to pay entrance fee (per pax and per car), yet it…"
"You need a proper guide to actually understand this fort (museum) or otherwise, just spend some 1 hour reading and exploring the history of Makassar, the gowa kingdom and lagaligo kingdom.

I think it is for the traveller and not the tourist but I am old and I don't like Kuta in Bali that much. There are some very good hotels in Makassar. Do not miss Paotere Harbour.

We've been handled by the ranger of Taka Bonerate, They persuade us to try a discovery dive. I'm not pro in swimming, i still wear my life jacket while snorkling, so how could i dive? I said it to one of the rangers, but they were very helpful. They explained to us so patiently, informed us that we can see more beautiful views down there. Then me and my friend did it and it was for free.  Coral & fish are very various, i also saw a giant shell, local people call it with ""KIMA"". It take years to grow, i heard they only grow 2 centimeter in a year. So, I think this kima is very old, maybe hundreds year? I only bring a standard camera for underwater, But the truth is the underwater view is very amazing. Then the dive site is famous for the nudy branch, sometimes divers will choose to experience a night dive in Taka Bonerate.  I stayed at Tinabo Island. I admit it that the facilities are less enough for the tourist. You should take bath with salt water. If you are a backpacker, you won't be disturbed with this kind of situation. The electricity will be shut down at 12PM. I suggest you to sleep outside in hammock because our room ""nudy branch"" is very small, and the air circulation wasn't good enough. When i arrived there, a new facility was added, such as air condition but only in a large bungalow, and the electricity will be shut down at midnight. So, pointless i think.   Food not very various, mainly you will eat fish everyday. If your are from outside Indonesia, you need to beware of the chili. This is a special chili from Selayar Island, chili is very small but it will burnt your tounge. I bought this chili for my mom in Jakarta after we arrived at Selayar. Yes, most of Indonesian reallyyyyyyy loves chili.   Then, i also went to ""Tarupa Kecil Island"" to meet a local tribe, Bajo. These tribe is very famous, they live nomadically. They only stay at this island maybe 2-3 months then move to other island. When we arrived at Tarupa Kecil Island, our guide climbed the coconut tree and we enjoy the coconut fruit to relieve our thirst. We pay nothing for the coconut but our guide pay it to the local people.   Then i also visit sandbanks, called ""BUNGIN TINABO"". We could see a lot of seagulls in here but when we landed in these area, the seagulls flew away. We took some pictures and others only laid down on the beach.   Tips:  Be friendly to local people, they will be very happy to explain everything they know about Taka Bonerate. Actually, they only wants you to decide that Taka Bonerate is a good place to visit and maybe one day you will come back to Taka Bonerate for sure. I made a new friend there.

The resorts has several air conditioned (AC) rooms and can accommodate about 10-20 people.  It has camping facilities which accommodates more than 20 people.  The island does not have fresh water facilities other than rainwater storage and carted drinking water from neighboring islands.  Everything, including foodstuffs have to be brought in by boat.  Electricity runs from 6am till 00:00.  There is daily regular public boat that connects it to the surrounding islands and mainland Selayar.  At night, the milky-way is crystal clear and it is gorgeous!  We did snorkling and diving and were disappointed by the level of destruction to the (once) beautiful coral reefs and gardens.  There were visible signs of coral destroyed through fish bombings!    During out stay, we met with Indonesia sea police patrol officers who have just apprehended fish bombers and loads of explosives.  They also confiscated a boat.  Taka Bonerate is in dire need of help!  The fish bombing has to be stopped and for this the people of Selayar and Indonesian Government need help!
