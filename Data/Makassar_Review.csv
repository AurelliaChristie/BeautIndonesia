"Fort Rotterdam is definitely one of the oldest and most intact forts in Indonesia. As such, it is certainly Makassar is premier historical site and we would recommend a visit here. The stone walls, Bone Bastion and Dutch-style buildings within the fort are all attractive and?","Many changes after 5 years, the place is amazing and beautiful for walking around, exercise in the morning sitting around and enjoy the views, very nice place for relax,","Our holiday in Taka Bonerate Marine National Park really one of the best experience for our family. We came for baby sharks and the atoll. And pak Agus our guide show us giant Kima, replanting coral area, and soft coral habitat.  Put on your sun glasses and sunblock, then enjoy the sun. Bring your personal medications just in case you stumble to naughty jellyfish, bring enough money to buy some fresh lobster. The nearest village is Rajuni island (and its do not have jetty).  Do not touch bright coral, some of it will burn your skin. And be careful when you feed baby shark, they are baby with sharp teeth <U+0001F605>. And sometimes there are baby stingray near the beach, watch your step.  We absolutely will come again.?","Bantimurung itself is a sample of over exploited nature attraction. Too much human interferes on the nature. Too many concrete constructions, paving blocks, etc. ","This is my 3rd time to go to this beach because this beach is simply so beautiful, you can find the clean white sands, blue sea water and and nice sky landscape, if you are go with tight budget, there is so many cheap hotels and inn around the entry","With the friendly price, we got the excelent service, welcoming drink, complete facility, good for family holiday, modern green concept, delicious food taste, feel secure, fast check in process and helpfull","Staying atvHarper was really good experience for me. Before my check in date, they sent me a reminder and provided me with advance information about my booking. The staff were very friendly and accomodating. The room and ammenities were all good. Breakfast buffet was excellent too!","The first time staying at the rinra hotel with friends, the service at the hotel was very friendly, the hotel was clean and the most interesting thing from the rinra hotel was the view while being in the pool was very cool anyway <U+0001F970>"
"It is a very old place with some traditional cottages. We liked the museum most because of some ancient things like tools for agriculture purpose, traditional dress and miniature of wooden house , picture of kings, very old weapons used many many years back etc.But I do not?",I guess this place is good at night. Our hotel had great sunset views and views of the sea and mosque so we went here during the day..there is nothing there. Just a few statues and stuff. ,"It is relatively easy to reach Taka Bonerate, comparing to other secluded/virgin beach or island in Indonesia. The snorkelling and diving site is still good.   The baby black tip shark is a delightful scenery in the morning. We got the front bungalow, meaning we could see the sunset while lounging at our terrace.?","Bantimurung National Park is located in Maros it?s about 2 hours from Makassar. You can enjoying the fresh air in here, exploring the cave, swimming in the waterfall and exploring the various type of butterflies and insects!   Also do not forget to buy souvenirs from locals.?",Bira have a very nice beach with white sand and sunshine.  You can see spectacular sunrise and sunset.  An excellent place to spent your holidays here.,"Very bad and rude that we got  from Mr. Dito as a reception. There is no smile and ""thank you"" words as a reception must be. How come? Please retrained your receptions staff to treat guest better. Thank you","Staying in this hotel was a great experience, it quickly became my favourite stay for a short business stop in Makassar. Close to the airport, and not too far from city centre. The breakfast was generous and delicious. The room was clean and neat, and  I appreciate its environmentally friendly approach: no plastic bottle! ",I had a very nice room overlooking the city! Very nice infinite swimming pool! Good breakfast! Very good staff. I came twice in the same week and I really did enjoy the place. I ll recommend as the right place in Makassar.
Interesting museum of Sulawesi history. Maintained very well. Informative with detailed write-up. Fairly large with multiple rooms. Cover the history from the Stone age up to the Dutch era,"One of the busiest sightseeing location in Makassar.  Known by the locals a place to visit to see the sunset.  If you want to avoid the crowds come during day time.  It comes alive at night.  There are tons of restaurants, food stalls, and shops in the area.  You can spend 2-3?","We had a very long travel time to get here, it was a night of bus trip along with two hours of ferry boat trip and then a night of boat trip... well yess... imagine by your self. I spent two nights in this islands, took four logs of diving and stayed in Rajuni Village... All I can say is you will be pleased with the underwater experience, it is the third biggest atoll in the world. Underwater visibility was clear... corals were amazing... met lots of exotic sea creatures. Well yess... all those time spent to get into this place was well paid. I suggest to take a plane to first get into Selayar and then get into Takabonerate by boat (I guess no better choice for this). ?","Went to Batimurrung to see the waterfall today, but after seeing the crowded parking lot with dozens of tacky souvenir shops and knowing foreigners are gouged for a US$ 20 admission fee, we just turned around and left. I am sure it once was a nice natural attraction, but from?","We visited this beach on holiday. It was very crowded. This beach is the main destination for holiday or weekend in South Sulawesi. From Makassar took about 5 hours by car. At the beach there were some stalls which sale food and drink, souvenirs and we can take a rest there.?","Parking area is bid enough to do jogging in the morning.Room is clean and the space is adequateVariety of food for breakfast shoul be improved. To call taxi or grab sometimes take a long time, due the trafic at Sumiharjo street.","Great location especially for those who has business n activities near airport, business district, university n so on. A bit distance from the city but highway will shortcut the distance. Great menu if breakfast. Highly recommended","Very good hotel,nice to stay in here i like it so much , the best view ever day, and tradisional food very intresting like it so bad. And very humble all of staff in here  the best hotel in makassar like it"
It?s near our hotel. However we took a trip with becak tricycle for Rp 200.000 from the hotel to the harbour and the fort in the end. I forgot if there was a ticket but the staff in the hut asked for a donation. I was afraid it was ended in the pocket.  We walked through the?,"When I visit this place is in the middle of the day and its crowded. The view was good. We can see beach, phinisi boat, and mosque with unique design. People say: you?re not officially come to Makassar if not visited Losari Beach.","I did snorkling at Taka Bonerate, it was very beautiful. We have been handled by the ranger of Taka Bonerate, They persuade us to try a discovery dive. I am not pro in swimming, i still wear my life jacket while snorkling, so how could i dive? I said it to one of the rangers, but they were very helpful. They explained to us so patiently, informed us that we can see more beautiful views down there. Then me and my friend did it and it was for free.  Coral & fish are very various, i also saw a giant shell, local people call it with ""KIMA"". It take years to grow, i heard they only grow 2 centimeter in a year. So, I think this kima is very old, maybe hundreds year? I only bring a standard camera for underwater, But the truth is the underwater view is very amazing. Then the dive site is famous for the nudy branch, sometimes divers will choose to experience a night dive in Taka Bonerate.  I stayed at Tinabo Island. I admit it that the facilities are less enough for the tourist. You should take bath with salt water. If you are a backpacker, you will not be disturbed with this kind of situation. The electricity will be shut down at 12PM. I suggest you to sleep outside in hammock because our room ""nudy branch"" is very small, and the air circulation was not good enough. When i arrived there, a new facility was added, such as air condition but only in a large bungalow, and the electricity will be shut down at midnight. So, pointless i think.   Food not very various, mainly you will eat fish everyday. If your are from outside Indonesia, you need to beware of the chili. This is a special chili from Selayar Island, chili is very small but it will burnt your tounge. I bought this chili for my mom in Jakarta after we arrived at Selayar. Yes, most of Indonesian reallyyyyyyy loves chili.   Then, i also went to ""Tarupa Kecil Island"" to meet a local tribe, Bajo. These tribe is very famous, they live nomadically. They only stay at this island maybe 2-3 months then move to other island. When we arrived at Tarupa Kecil Island, our guide climbed the coconut tree and we enjoy the coconut fruit to relieve our thirst. We pay nothing for the coconut but our guide pay it to the local people.   Then i also visit sandbanks, called ""BUNGIN TINABO"". We could see a lot of seagulls in here but when we landed in these area, the seagulls flew away. We took some pictures and others only laid down on the beach.   Tips:  Be friendly to local people, they will be very happy to explain everything they know about Taka Bonerate. Actually, they only wants you to decide that Taka Bonerate is a good place to visit and maybe one day you will come back to Taka Bonerate for sure. I made a new friend there.  No internet connection, you need to change your network to 2G network. Only works for phone call in very limited time, we can not predict when the signal is strong/weak.?","I went there with my best friend and we found easily to get there simply by local angkot; but unfortunately it wasn?t me who arranged the transportation, it was her, so I don?t think I can share the details of the route how to get there from Makassar; one thing I recall is it?","Its okay, when we visit its during weekday so its quite empty. The area needs massive development, specially for hotels and food places.",the hotel room is very contemporary with lobby hotel decor that is beautiful to look at. Serves a nice breakfast and has a swimming pool that is comfortable for children. Has a large outdoor area and can be used for various events. Service is a bit long when leaving the hotel.,"The hotel is ten minutes from the airport and the zoned rate from the airport is less than Grab and far less than the hotel will charge you.  Despite the proximity to the airport there is no noise.  Rooms are spacious, clean and modern.  Front desk staff and manager on the late night shift were very helpful in getting Garuda to deliver a lost bag in time for the next leg of my journey.","We are stayed at this hotel from 18.feb until 23.feb. We are from Germany, My friend Mr. Christian is Germany and i am Indonesien but live in Germany.  From the first time we arrived, we didn?t get a great welcome greeting from the Receptions staff. They are even didn?t offer us a welcome drink even the welcome drinks is right to the next of the front desk and we have to do self service. The room was ok, but they are haven?t a enough wardrobes to put our clothes.  Then the next day, we are going to breakfast. All the food is cold except the soup. Coffee was horrible and we are asked for a fresh coffee and luckily they?re want to give us a fresh coffee from the coffee machine. The staff (restaurant and the receptionist) mostly not friendly, doesn?t greeting us everytime we?"
"It was an interesting visit, mostly because its the only VOC fort still standing (or so we were told). There is a small museum that tells you a bit of the history. Another building that we wanted to visit, was closed. All in all, we stayed there for about half an hour.","Visited in the morning hours,  when the crowds were not present. Once there , one can see the most photographed sites of Makassar,  especially the lettering (City of Makassar, Losari etc).Tons of Kodak moments.  Just be aware that it can get very hot during the afternoon hours,?","We went to Taka Bonerate by plane from Makassar, South Sulawesi and stayed at the Tinobo island resort.  It was gorgeous!  Everyday, 24/7 we swam with 100s baby sharks mostly black and white tips.   The island is a small island which can be circled in 1 hour walk.  The resorts has several air conditioned (AC) rooms and can accommodate about 10-20 people.  It has camping facilities which accommodates more than 20 people.  The island does not have fresh water facilities other than rainwater storage and carted drinking water from neighboring islands.  Everything, including foodstuffs have to be brought in by boat.  Electricity runs from 6am till 00:00.  There is daily regular public boat that connects it to the surrounding islands and mainland Selayar.  At night, the milky-way is crystal clear and it is gorgeous!  We did snorkling and diving and were disappointed by the level of destruction to the (once) beautiful coral reefs and gardens.  There were visible signs of coral destroyed through fish bombings!    During out stay, we met with Indonesia sea police patrol officers who have just apprehended fish bombers and loads of explosives.  They also confiscated a boat.  Taka Bonerate is in dire need of help!  The fish bombing has to be stopped and for this the people of Selayar and Indonesian Government need help!    Please go and visit the Atol and voice your concerns on what you see.  Snorkling and diving in the mainland Selayar is gorgeous!  This is a separate review.?","Bantimurung has so many amazing places to visit. If you want to enjoy the olden times era, just come here and feel the historic moment. Leang Leang is one of Bantimurung squad. This place is very appropriate to with your friends, family, and youe couple too. The green view is?","It is worth if your final destination is snorkeling or island hopping to Pulau Kambing and Pulau Liukang Loe. If you are taking long hours ride from Makassar just to spend time on this beach, I would not recommend because you have to pay entrance fee (per pax and per car), yet it?","hotel maxone sangat cocok untuk anda yang ingin menginap di hotel dengan suasana yang asri dan alami, membuat anda berasa menginap di rumah sendiri. Anda yang menginap di hotel maxone juga sangat di manjakan dengan berbagai macam fasilitas yang terbilang lengkap.Maxone hotel is perfect for those of you who want to stay in a hotel with a beautiful and natural atmosphere, making you feel like staying at home.

"You need a proper guide to actually understand this fort (museum) or otherwise, just spend some 1 hour reading and exploring the history of Makassar, the gowa kingdom and lagaligo kingdom.  Upon entry, there is voluntary payment (which i thought was official) and u do not actually?","I love Makassar. I think it is for the traveller and not the tourist but I am old and I do not like Kuta in Bali that much. There are some very good hotels in Makassar. Do not miss Paotere Harbour. Maybe watch the sun go down at Panti Gapura. Walk along JL Somba Opu northbound,?","Our holiday in Taka Bonerate Marine National Park really one of the best experience for our family.

It was quiet and I could hear sea wave, it made me sleepy. I was sleeping for 40mins on small shop around the beach haha  Even the most cheap food will taste like michelin?","this hotel has a nice view, clean and friendly staff. but it was just that their room service was very slow. I had to call the receptionist for many times for some service. and for those of you who bring the vehicle I suggest to report so that parking fees are not charged.",Clean rooms with confortable beds. Ok gym for some exercises and a pool to relax in. Some more basic Spa offers. But service in the restaurant is extremely slow and do not expect a drink before dinner. ,i like the rinra makassar hotel because the service and cleanliness of the hotel and rooms are very well maintained. even here I see the friendliness of staff towards guests and not the same as other hotels that are not too familiar with guests and more to see guests here and there only passing and passing. at the rinra hotel always greeting and reprimanding and being a positive example

Fort Rotterdam is located near to the Port of Makassar. It is the only heritage site that you would see around he area as it is surrounded by modern shop houses. Entering the port is free but getting into 2 of its museums within would require you to pay a small entrance fee.  ?,I enjoyed my time here since I was kid until now the place is always been the favourite place for enjoying sunset and various culinary,"We had a very long travel time to get here, it was a night of bus trip along with two hours of ferry boat trip and then a night of boat trip... well yess... imagine by your self.

A must see visit in Makassar. But that is also because in Makassar there are not a lot of things to visit. Not very special.,"Losari Beach is not a beach.

Overall a great experience, would definitely stay there again when I visit Makassar.","I mostly stay here when I visited Makassar. For business travel or for family vacation. The room is clean, food was great with many option from western even local food. Unfortunately I never tried its swimming pool. The pool size is quite large. Someday I have to try it.",the first time I visited this hotel was because of the office event that was held at the Rinra. namely Samsung very satisfying service to hotel facilities. the room is also very clean and spacious and has a very cool view. the advantages of this hotel turned out to be following the modern era and the TV uses iFtv which makes it easy for us to order food and be able to watch YouTube on TV
Good place to spend evening in the heart of Makassar. No fee to enter this location. You must come to this place when going to Makassar,"I love this coastal path , we can find many thing we need, food , mosque, entertainment, sunset beach , and you should try pisang epe , the one of very popular traditional dessert , great coffee will make your afternoon sunset absolutely completed","We had a very long travel time to get here, it was a night of bus trip along with two hours of ferry boat trip and then a night of boat trip... well yess... imagine by your self. I spent two nights in this islands, took four logs of diving and stayed in Rajuni Village... All I can say is you will be pleased with the underwater experience, it is the third biggest atoll in the world. Underwater visibility was clear... corals were amazing... met lots of exotic sea creatures. Well yess... all those time spent to get into this place was well paid. I suggest to take a plane to first get into Selayar and then get into Takabonerate by boat (I guess no better choice for this). ?",We went to the place in the afternoon to see what is this National Park has to offer. I went there for the waterfall alone actually and it was OK. Turns out to be it is a good place to spend a day with the family. It was a weekend when I visited and it was quite packed.

The rooms are decent in size and the rooms smell really fresh with very good scent. The breakfast is splendid and the wifi is very decent too. Staff here are friendly and dependable and they are very much willing to help you out in whatever requests you have. It is one of the better hotels in Makassar.,"Good, I stayed at Harper Perintis for 4 nights. The hotel is comfortable, clean and not noisy between rooms.

Please improve the front of the service, especially the bellboy who helps bring guest bag",the better hotel located in the shopping district of Makassar. excellent for the price room or the food. hotel connect mall. Enjoyed ! many variatif food in breakfast and nice view. I like swimming pool and Bar cafe
"i enjoyed visiting this museum. It displays a lot of information about the past condition of Makassar and their tribes. For internatinal tourists, the bilingual explanation would facilitate them to enjoy the museum as well.",The cleanliness of the area is more attention and it is better for street vendors not to disturb visitors. More improved in arrangement and added facilities for residents.,"I did snorkling at Taka Bonerate, it was very beautiful. We have been handled by the ranger of Taka Bonerate, They persuade us to try a discovery dive. I am not pro in swimming, i still wear my life jacket while snorkling, so how could i dive? I said it to one of the rangers, but they were very helpful. They explained to us so patiently, informed us that we can see more beautiful views down there. Then me and my friend did it and it was for free.  Coral & fish are very various, i also saw a giant shell, local people call it with ""KIMA"". It take years to grow, i heard they only grow 2 centimeter in a year. So, I think this kima is very old, maybe hundreds year? I only bring a standard camera for underwater, But the truth is the underwater view is very amazing. Then the dive site is famous for the nudy branch, sometimes divers will choose to experience a night dive in Taka Bonerate.  I stayed at Tinabo Island. I admit it that the facilities are less enough for the tourist. You should take bath with salt water. If you are a backpacker, you will not be disturbed with this kind of situation. The electricity will be shut down at 12PM. I suggest you to sleep outside in hammock because our room ""nudy branch"" is very small, and the air circulation was not good enough. When i arrived there, a new facility was added, such as air condition but only in a large bungalow, and the electricity will be shut down at midnight. So, pointless i think.   Food not very various, mainly you will eat fish everyday. If your are from outside Indonesia, you need to beware of the chili. This is a special chili from Selayar Island, chili is very small but it will burnt your tounge. I bought this chili for my mom in Jakarta after we arrived at Selayar. Yes, most of Indonesian reallyyyyyyy loves chili.   Then, i also went to ""Tarupa Kecil Island"" to meet a local tribe, Bajo. These tribe is very famous, they live nomadically. They only stay at this island maybe 2-3 months then move to other island. When we arrived at Tarupa Kecil Island, our guide climbed the coconut tree and we enjoy the coconut fruit to relieve our thirst. We pay nothing for the coconut but our guide pay it to the local people.   Then i also visit sandbanks, called ""BUNGIN TINABO"". We could see a lot of seagulls in here but when we landed in these area, the seagulls flew away. We took some pictures and others only laid down on the beach.   Tips:  Be friendly to local people, they will be very happy to explain everything they know about Taka Bonerate. Actually, they only wants you to decide that Taka Bonerate is a good place to visit and maybe one day you will come back to Taka Bonerate for sure. I made a new friend there.  No internet connection, you need to change your network to 2G network. Only works for phone call in very limited time, we can not predict when the signal is strong/weak.?",Nice park you can butterfly fly around and you can swimming under waterfall.

The resorts has several air conditioned (AC) rooms and can accommodate about 10-20 people.  It has camping facilities which accommodates more than 20 people.  The island does not have fresh water facilities other than rainwater storage and carted drinking water from neighboring islands.  Everything, including foodstuffs have to be brought in by boat.  Electricity runs from 6am till 00:00.  There is daily regular public boat that connects it to the surrounding islands and mainland Selayar.  At night, the milky-way is crystal clear and it is gorgeous!  We did snorkling and diving and were disappointed by the level of destruction to the (once) beautiful coral reefs and gardens.  There were visible signs of coral destroyed through fish bombings!    During out stay, we met with Indonesia sea police patrol officers who have just apprehended fish bombers and loads of explosives.  They also confiscated a boat.

The room is quite a standard, nice bed, comfy pillow, one thing that i cant understand is, why they make the door for the closet connected to the door for the bath areas.. so if you want to close your closet, you can?t close the bath area.. and if you want to close the bath area you can?t cole the closet... it?s kinda funny actually, because it?s the same door, if you know what i mean.. too bad i forgot to take pictures  But the pool...

a worthy place to visit in the afternoon whenever you find yourself in Makassar. Well maintained but sadly I still could find some trash in there :(,"Just an ordinary promenade (no beach) with some ""LOSARI"", ""MAKASSAR"" and ""TORAJA"" huge signs and the statues of some Sulawesi, Indonesia and world leaders for photo taking purpose.

Thanks God they stopped at 12.00AM - My neighbour accross my room was so noisy and yes, it was very loud n clear too - Towel was ""brown"" with black spots around. Not a 5stars standard definitely! - requested for ocean view but they gave me corner room so definitely could not see the ocean clearly - went to the pool in the morning as I was amazed with the pictures of their pool area in the internet but again, very dissapointed.?"
Fort Rotterdam was really great for me to see as a South Africa due to our countries shared colonial history. We have a small area in Cape Town named after it! The fort is in good condition and has a small museum inside which has some interesting things to see but nothing that?,"First of all, don go there with bikinies cause it is not a beach.

I recommend to see the sunset there.",,,,,"If you are in business trip and having a connection flight, then Harper Perintis would be the best alternative since its location only about 15-minute drive from/to Sultan Hasannudin Airport in Ujung Pandang. The hotel is quiet new, launched last year so that we can still enjoy the priviledge of new facilities. The breakfast menu is quiet various with good quality. And you can also order nasi goreng for room service with a good deal. We were welcome by Mbak Fira, a rookie, and serviced us very well at reservation desk. Thanks to Mbak Fira for her warm welcome. Harper Perintis is integrated with some culinary spots.  Regards. Enjoy Makassar @ Harper Perintis.  Ari K.","It is not recommended for biz trip. I could not find any proper biz center.

In my opinion, I can say that Harper Perintis was the best of the three. When we first arrived, we were welcomed by warm greetings and fresh beverage. In spite of being newly built, the service is very good and the hotel staffs are very friendly. The room is cozy, quite spacy, accessible to the wifi and the unique thing is that there is a bluetooth speaker which also functions as a digital clock. The bathroom is also comfortable and has liquid shampoo and soap in containers hung on the wall so it made me easier to use.

The gym itself is good enough, the swimming pool is very clean, the water is crystal clear. Nice breakfast, but still capable of more improvement. The only downside of my experience (the reason that i decided to give 4/5) the hotel is lack of baby cribs (they provide but not much).

Nice fort with a nice slice of Dutch history.

"Impressed with the structure of course. Still strong and still having the touch of the colonizations. However, the museum has nothing much to be seen. practically not spending much time here but worth a piece or two pictures here.

Around that 30min many staff keep coming in and out FO area but NO one seems to be bothered that 3 guest stand in line waiting to be served.   After that I still wait another 5min so around 35-40min standing. Then another guest that saw me wait already more than 30min yelled to FO staff and call me to come forward beside him to be served together with him If he did not call me maybe I still had to wait?

I suppose I was expecting a real fort & this was more like a large monastery with a church in the middle of a huge quadrangle with covered walks.  The only evidence of the old 16th century fort was the outer walls & it was possible to walk on a small part of the ramparts.

Makassar is not a tourist destination and seems to operate in a very relaxed manner. We made the effort to go down to the old fort and enjoyed seeing the fort (which is quite large). There is a small museum that had a selection (if not basic) of old pieces (manly swords). It is?,This is not really a beach in the classical sense.  Most of the area has been reclaimed.

I think its not the first time that this happened because i saw there is another 2 hole on the ceiling. I hope somebody take a serious action about this because yeah i scared that something terrible gonna happen to the building. Btw its?

Our room was on the 6th floor (designated non-smoking floor) and offered expansive views of the waterfront and pool areas. The infinity pool is a popular hangout for guests and visitors. The hotel is buffet breakfast offered an ample selection of western and local favorites, though quality of the food is nothing to rave about. The gym was not ready yet, and the hotel caters to smokers, which is unfortunate for us who are very sensitive to cigarette smoke. Alas, the nicotine smells wafted through the ventilation system.

The Concierge Staff very responsive took care our luggage and has heavy smile. Whatta a good farewell

The rooms are good, the breakfast is fair. There are some odd design features (strange window from the bedroom to bathroom, a large column for the TV set that takes up a large part of the room and plants at the pool that obstruct what could have been a great view of the city) which suggests that some things have not been thought through yet. We had a room with a view over some industrial building, not very interesting. But the rooms are clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, parts of the hotel were not finished yet in January 2017. There was no gym yet and a nice viewing deck was not accessible either. The staff is super friendly. The breakfast is fair and offers a reasonably wide range of?"

Bathroom is not convinient for people sharing room with friend because there is open window space between the bathroom & bed room although it can be close with door from the cabinet.
Nice for a walk around. But for some reason many of the buildings are not accessable. The museum was interesting but many of the display lights were off and we couldnt see very well.,"I do not know why they called this a beach, even tough the fact that this just a city boulevard where so many cafes, restaurant inside it...it is always overcrowded in the night and the traffic just crazy...",,,,,,"The Rinra is categories a new hotel.

They tried offering us another room that have a higher price but we refused.  And after waiting in the lobby exactly one hour without certainty, i go to the reception to ask and then they said there was a room cancellation.

Well shortly saying, i was taking a couple of Singaporean to enjoy Makassar, and instead of getting a good start, they refused to stay at your Hotel.  Your pillow was tainted and my whole experience as i stayed there with my nephew,  if it was not because of the pool, i would never ever stay in your hotel. Not with that kind of service level."
Ford Rotterdam is a place we had to visit because we are from Rotterdam. We had a hotel close to it so it was just a short walk.

"Unless you are crazy about visiting Dutch fort you will probably have very limited interest, only the small museum is ok, so if you have one hour free in your schedule, why not.","Very popular for local Indonesians, it seems. Phones illuminating everyone is faces as they take selfies.  Walked around for a while and took some photos, that is about it.  Not really a beach either, more of a pier.

It would be great once nearby construction and next door mall is completed in a few months."

I like their various tasty breakfast. Many choice and delicious.  Waitress in bar/pool area arent nice AT ALL. No smile. And looks they dont like to explain the menu to guest.
