Checked-in staffs are chatty, welcoming and assigned quickly into Family room; however, very strict on key rooms as we have mentioned staying in Family room means we need 3 keys but this being ignored - strictly 2 only.  Totally appreciate the sustainability concept of the hotel to provide water dispenser.

And They have float rental for swan white float and duck float for IDR 15k for 15 mins only. The only minus of this hotel was the food. I tried the food for breakfast and it was disappointing.

It was cheap, of course for the price we paid we couldn't expect too much. Bathrooms were outside the room, the room literally had nothing but 2 bunk beds. The room was clean, so were the bathrooms. And the view was amaaaazing, our room was facing a mountain.  Food in the hotel was really reasonably priced. Like as in...cheap. None of that ridiculously priced hotel food.   Location-wise, it is super convenient. Walking distance to jatim park, nearby food stalls. About 15 minutes drive from Coban Rondo.

The room was clean, spacious, and the bed was comfortable for us.  Breakfast: they have quite a big variety of food and beverages.

This would a be a nice hotel to bring kids as they have an outdoor playground, kids swimming pool and a big slide in the adult pool as well.

We did not agree and ended up sort of convincing them; we did not have to pay the extra in the end.",The Surrounding view is Superb ... love the Mountain View and the fresh air  for the whole day. The Suites Room is spacious and the room is clean. I will definitely recommend Aston Inn Batu as the best place to stay in Batu - Malang.,"Stayed for 1 evening on the 7th floor with great views overlooking the mountain, the evening temperature is cool and it's advisable to wear long sleeves or a light jacket. The King Size bed was comfy and the room amenities were excellent. Had dinner at the Branche Restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the portions as well as the taste. The buffet breakfast was good and diverse also. This isn't a Batu quality hotel, this is definitely Bali quality luxury accommodation with Batu prices.  I tried swimming in the big pool and it was freezing, so they could definitely improve that. Apart from that, it was a memorable stay and given the chance, I would definitely return."
"Absolutely gorgeous! It's a must visit on a tour to Batu, Malang. All animals were look well cared and well fed. The zoo design was smart and creative.

If u come with lil one, would be good if you can ask for the suites room 208, bigger space, own living room and bath tub with a little surprise, no windows overlooking mountainous view and valley, well they have shades if you feel a little bit unconfortable.  One downside but very minor..if you let the window open, the noise of the cars about will wake you up in the morning, well cool morning will make you shut the window anyway.

The staff were helpful although they had difficulty communicating in English. But some of the information they gave was not exactly accurate, especially regarding the places of interest in the area. It could be a case of miscommunication though. On the whole, we enjoyed our stay at Batu Villas and if we do return to Batu, we will stay at this place again. If you need a massage, ask for the elderly housekeeping 'Ibu'. We had a very good one by her after she finished her work. And she charged so reasonably.","The experience you can get here depends very much on your luck. If it is not too busy it can be like floating in heaven - the breakfast on the rooftop restaurant with the view on mount Arjuna, I mean. The choice of the breakfast buffet is somewhat limited, however. No western dishes or freshly squeezed juices, like I experienced in 2 other hotels of the Aston chain, are unheard of on these premises. The very same place can get a bit hell-like if you find yourself amidst a tour group. They can be awfully noisy, leaving a mess and almost full plates behind, smoking like, yea, hell.. you get the picture. The rooms are decent, go for the deluxe, 615 my favourite, as superior rooms are just too small.

But, if you are in Batu for sightseeing and spend your most of the time outside the hotel, then this is the best hotel. The superior room is relatively small, but as the time goes by we were able to adapt. The wall is not soundproof. I bet it is very noisy during holiday season. It is a 3 or 4-star, not a 5-star hotel anyway. Each room has a balcony and great views. Breakfast offers a widespread of variety, but improvement in taste and quality is needed. I do think the chef is creative and talented, but the hotel has a limited budget. The staffs are great and put a great effort to make guests satisfied.

Actually this place is always busy with local n outsiders visitors. It makes sense when we saw many animals which we never see in other zoo in Malaysia. we can get a closeup pics with animals.  I like the way they design the zoo which makes us follow the path without missing any?,"While you are in Jawa Timur, and you are travelling with kids, spent your time at Jatim Park 1, 2 and eco green park. The place is very good for learning about animal, plants, science,and  56 amazing rides are in Jatim park 1, at Jatim park 2 there are a museum, zoo, and rides.?",,,"This is a must go location when you are around Malang. You can see many old cars inside there and this is amazing place especially for children and car lovers. Not only cars, you can see other vehicle here.",,"The view from the rooftop restaurant is amazing, but the restaurant staff should be more competent. The bathroom size is quite small and the closet drainage was stuck a bit. The balcony door could not be closed properly.","I loved to stay in this hotel. There was a cool outdoor restaurant that was decorated with leaves on a glass roof. They had a garden and aa amazing spot to take photos. More over, they had an awesome water slide. It's about 5 meters high. =). They had a water slide for kids also. In the indoor pool they had warm pool where kids enjoyed so much. Something that can be improved is the breakfast. The food was good, but they didn't have a variaty of foods (compare to the other 5 stars hotels)."
"The zoo has a good variety of animals. And I like the fact that they manage to somehow design the zoo with such small space.   I do have to be concerned with the size of the confinements and shelters for the animals. I have mixed sentiments against zoos to begin with, but the?","you'd better come visit there in the morning, maybe at 9 o'clock. Cause u have ur own place to take a pic with ur friend in here. hehe. and the ticket price is cheap enough lol :)) ps. sorry about my bad english. but i recommend this place. the score is 7/10  haha (y)",,,Its huge and spaceful.

Overall its a nice park,,"good experience stayed in Aston Inn Batu, great location near many attraction, and kind if foodbto choice, need more day to complete my journey of trying local food in East Java, maybe next trip i will go again to visit","Good place! The lobby looks good. I love the aromatherapy in this hotel corridors. But so sad I cannot use hair dryer, because they don't have power plug. The bakery in this hotel not complete, so sad I didn't see croissant. "
If you are traveling with young children this place is a MUST to visit . There are 2 sites - Museum Satwa and Batu Secret Zoo . Recommend that you spend a whole day there to fully enjoy the facilities.   The Museum Satwa features statue of artificial animals -  very beautifully?,"It's fun place for families, and gathering. Just IDR 60.000/person we can enjoy 56 amazing rides, a wonderful time in Jawa Timur Park1.",,,Everybody having a lot of fun here...  They have hundreds of cars collection from around the world and in supreme condition.  And also themed for every cars from different country.  Next to this place also have pasar apung which sell many kinds traditional street food.,,"We are running out of the family room and opt for a deluxe room with an additional extra bed. The room is big enough for four of us (2 adults, my 7 years old daughter and my 4 years old son). The view is mountain, however we got third floor, so the view is not so good. The sound isolation is very poor - we can easily hear sound from the parking ground, whisper from neighboring room and loud step from the alley. We found the emergency stairs have been used for smoking by visitors. Pool are very small for a four star hotel. The food from room service (sop buntut) are chewey and though. The plus point is the location (walking distance to jatim park 1 and museum angkut), the staff service and the breakfast buffet! Need some improvement definitely! Ps. Even tough we book deluxe room?","I chose this hotel hoping to have a 4-5 star experience while staying in Batu, Malang.   But I don't think they put enough effort to keep the hotel clean and FREE FROM FLIES.   Flies are everywhere in the lobby. They are n the floor, the sofa, and the tables. It is like being in a street market, not a 4/5-star hotel. The duty manager said that it is because of the ""season"".   Well from my point of view, it seems like the lobby area is not cleaned thoroughly. I can see that the floor is a little greasy, probably from food spills from the last banquet.  They have to put more effort to keep the lobby clean, mop it more frequently with disinfectants. Daily sweeping won't be enough. If the ""fly season"" is coming, they should consider using a PEST CONTROL SERVICE to reduce the number?"
"Not only children but adults also will like it.  I love to see animals from near.  They have manyyyy types about animals that I never see it before.  Not only take a picture with them but also you can feed the animals  Fyi if you take citilink airplane, show your boarding pass?","This was a surprisingly interesting place to visit, despite it's out of date style and some rather tired attractions. It's cheap, and is especially educational for children and adults. All of the signage is in Bahasa Indonesia, and so if you are not fluent in the language, then?",,,"in this place, you will learn about the history about cars, planes, and another transportation. i go here with my parents, and they just said like, ""oh!! this cars i still remember it! i used to see it when i'm in high school!"". nice to see my parents happy!",,"Hotel Clean, hospitality, friendly, nice breakfast , near our children School ( Al Izzah Boarding School ), our expectation or improvement is the Swimming area ... we hope that the swimming area is more big for family. one big swimming pool for adults and for children.","Welcomed warmly by the staffs. Hotel was super clean and I got nothing to be complained. Located near jatim park made this hotel good for family trip! Sure I will stay here with my family in the future.  Special thanks to Mr. Ali the manager, Nurie and Suci the front officer they were superb! "
"I already had my expectation low when it's about smaller zoos in Indonesia esp since the entrance fee is cheap, but this place still strikes me as bad. A lot of animals are dirty, unenergetic, and look stressed. Some cages smell bad. The alpacas, for example, have dirty furs?","We had a good time at Jatim Park. A perfect huge place to go for family especially with the kids. We went there on holiday season and it cost IDR60,000 per person. Its cheap price with all the facilities provided. more than 50 games facilities we can use with no additional cost.?",,,I really recommend this place for you to visit.

At museum satwa which displayed real animal as statue was very awesome, reallyba world?",,,,Great display of transport collection and some nice kiddy rides but nothing too spectacular. Pasar Apung section is better in my opinion and Heritage Museum nearby is my highlight of the trip here. I guess thats a reflection of my interest.,,"Had 1 night stay with my family. Just brand new hotel with nice room ambience and views around. Helpful staff welcomed our request to check in early and granted us an upgrade room. Mbak Noerma always stay in touch with customers at breakfast time. We had delicious food with the perfect morning view at rooftop. Hotel location is just perfect and near the tourism spots in BATU (2 minutes to Museum Angkut and Kusuma Agrowisata, less 5 minutes to Jatim Park 1 and about 10 minutes to Jatim Park 3). Recommended and will back for stay in this hotel for sure.","Just went to this hotel for family holiday, we took the premiere king room The room is neat, clean and nice But we got the room next to door passage, so we can hear people open and close the door, and sometime the door is slammed The breakfast here is served lot of variety food, you can get indonesian food (local food) and international food such as sushi, pasta etc oh the serve very delicious dessert here But there is lot of flies, this must be solve by the management.

We had a very pleasant experience during that. The recepsionist was very helpful finding us the best rooms to accomodate our family of eight. We had  two spacy connected rooms with a nice view to the city of Batu and mount Arjuna. The restaurant also had a great view especially at night. The food was delicious for reasonable price. The breakfast menu had just enough variety to satisfy your appetite.  Location wise, the hotel was strategically located near Jatim park 1,  museum angkut and Alun-Alun Batu. The swimming pool is quite big. Our kids had so much fun with it. The only problem  we had was the that there was something wrong with the tv on our last night staying there.

I stayed in the room number 5116. It was spacious with two single beds and warm pillows and sheet.   I could see the sky while lying on the bed as the window was ceiling high and I could open it widely and let the fresh air flew into my bedroom. I thought, I did not need the AC. Not at all.   I checked the bathroom and tand I found a bath tub right beside the bathroom window, Perhaps, while you are soaking yourself in the tub, you can see the local resident's washing hanging. Why? Because right in front of the bathroom window is the back yard of the local's house. They hang their washing in the backyard.  So, please make sure, no one can see you?"

Every year I've visited this place. Nothing change. All good with all animals keep safe and healthy. Nice place for spending time with beloved or family.,,,,"I spent about two hours here and that felt too rushed.

Cars of all sorts but also an aviation section and then the different 'country' themed rooms such as Germany, France,?",,"Overall was good experience stay at Aston, good location, near from tourist destination but need improve for staff at restaurant especially when breakfast. Lack of restaurant staff, slow in refilling food.",Very great place to family vacation. The pool was awsome and variety food for the breakfast was amazing!  One thing to remember the check in time in this hotel is 15.00 and the check out time is 12.00 but the receptions will call us if our room is ready before 15.00.

If you need quiet room need to avoid the mosque direction. plenty of carpark lot. the hotel is half way up to the hill with very nice view if u pick the city view. ",The relatively new hotel is located only 3 min from the Jatim Park 2 Entrance and not far from Jatim Park 3.  If you are planning to bring your kids to the parks than this is an ideal choice.  Room was nicely decorated and comfortable.  Its nicely designed but far from 5-star luxury feel.  Most parts of the room were clean and tidy except for the carpet which we find dust and small debris accumulating in the visible corners.    Food are excellent. Tried some of the recommended dish and very satisfied. Unfortunately the restaurant (only one available) was understaffed during dinner time. We have to wait quite a while to be seated and served.  Other guest from adjacent table were furious because of the timeliness. I myself need to approach the waiters twice to check on the food. ?
easy place to get around with just about every animal you could think about housed there in good conditions.  Somewhat maddening backing music the only downside.  Ticket included entry into a stuffed animal museum which also had a extensive display of insects.,,,,Located at Batu Malang about 18 km from city center of Malang or 30 to 45 minutes by car.

Dicky, Ali and their team did an amazing job making me feel at home. The live music at night is awesome and the ambiance of the whole place... I cannot put into words! The food at breakfast, lunch and dinner was all amazing and the pool has a water slide! They also have billiards, ping pong and every amenity I can think of! Thank you to all of the staff at the Golden Tulip: I will return and recommend to all of my friends that visit this area.  Cheers,  Dr. Alyse Harvison"

As I heard that this is a new hotel I think they need improvement for the cleanliness for all area.  The lobby is so nice.. They have open air lobby lounge or bar, a good place to sit around with your family or friends.  The coffee also taste good for me.  Cool pool and great view.  The breakfast also great.. With many choices for indonesian and international buffet. Well for the restaurant need to improve their service during breakfast especially the omelette station.. Took so long, I assume because on that day was so crowded with groups and fit.  The location also near to jatim park 2.  Keep it up and thanks!! "
"We visit batu secret zoo as a part of Jatim Park 2. The animal collection was so varied and interesting. If we tired of walking, we can rent an electric bike and stroll through the zoo.

Overall it was a great experience.","Hotels is very good,having a good location so in main lobby we will have a good view of the city below and the  mountain scenery. Considering as boutique or luxury hotel based on its price then its having a unique hotel desain, again the open concept of main lobby with fresh cold mountain air, make guest enjoy to spend time there. Pool also great, having kiddie pool with water playground, also deep/adult pool with big water sliding. Then we can soaking in warm water pool, shallow enough for the kid to play too.

The room is big enough to add an extra bed (since I travelled with 3 persons). Each room has a balcony to enjoy the view (it could be better if you could get a higher room, but since i got the fifth floor, i still can enjoy the view). The bathroom is clean. They have a lot to offer for breakfast, they have a salad, bread, cereals, main course like rice and other side dishes, pudding, fresh fruit. The staff are friendly and the one in front office, they always greet you whenever they see you coming in or coming out the lobby (typical javanese hospitality i guess).

But no welcome drink (or only I didnt get it?)  Our room is spacious, comfy bed and amazing view from the balcony.  Bahtroom with shower and bathtub. But with limited amenities compared to other 5-star hotels.   Pool is amazing with kids pool. Indoor pool with warm water is available.   The buffet breakfast has much option.   Overall, I enjoyed my stay. "
It has been 5 years since my last visit to this zoo. My memory about this place has been amazing and this visit makes me remember those memories. It has a lot of nice animals and they are really take care very well by the zoo. Five star for the management of this zoo. It also?,,,,This place was very attractive. It display many cars and other transportation. They arrange this place nicely. They do have photo taking too if you want with a fee.   It isa big place and you need atleast 3hours to move around this place. Ther also a floating restaurant. You?,,,"I stay in this hotel for about 5 days with meeting package and all day dine in and while I write this, this is my last day before checkin out. I heard many bad things about this hotel before I arrived like bad services, slow response, a lot of flies in the restaurant, cold meals, etc, so I lowering my expectation.  When I arrived, i falling in love with the view, open-space design, cold wind of batu and fresh air. When I enter the room, I?m a bit disappointed with cleanliness, specially bathroom area and balcony. Seeing the facilities, this hotel very suitable for family. They have kids pool, playing arena, open space with nice view. However the restaurant is very small and very crowded during high occupancy.  Now, the meal. Meal is quite vary, with taste not bad. But, yes, it?"
The big zoo in Indonesia ... good than Singapore zoo. And so many animals in there and so many toilets in there,,,,"price was affordable...well groomed staff...and ""wow"" collection inside, we also can try RI1 airplane replica, dont forget to watch drama musical",,," I think this hotel is the best hotel in batu nowdays , rooms are clean, bathrooms are clean, rooms are modern style. bed is also comfortable.  children's playground there is an indoor and outdoor pool. strategic location, very close to Jatim Park 2 and BNS"
"I was there with some friends of mine for a weekend getaway. Fortunately, even that was at the weekend, the crowds were ok. Since the zoo is located in a cooler area of East Java, we can enjoy sightseeing on a sunny day. You can spend hours inside because they really have a lot?",,,,my first visit to the transport museum with the family.children are very enthusiastic they can see the old vehicle and see a lot of transportation in it.the most loved by the children of the floating shop before heading to the museum entrance.the museum is extraordinarily large?,,,"Stayed here for 2N during the peak season in December. This brand new resort is probably a right choice if you're looking for a luxury accomodation with modern design in Batu. This hotel offers plenty of facilities for your family to play around. It's also got great mountain view from the lobby! My room was deluxe room (which was very spacious) with the balcony overlooking the beautiful garden & the wedding chapel. However, IMHO this hotel also lacks the full *5 experience. The bathroom smells terrible. I asked reception to change my room & i think it happened in almost every room. The breakfast was also not the kind of bfast you'd expect from a *5 resort.   So for me, it's still a nice hotel. But it definitely needs some improvements to complete the *5 experience."
"We visited many zoos in the UK, Europe & South East Asia, and this is one of the best!  Animals are well kept. We saw healthy animals with natural behaviours all around. The enclosures are large enough, clean, enough food.  Visitors area are very clean, pleasant path to walk and?",,,,"The most place that i've enjoyed during my holiday.

But it worth the visit since the place was nice.",,,,Very good place for instagram feed. There are a lot of spot that instagramable. They are give so many sign to the guests in the floor about where you can take a picture in there. If you go there in the afternoon about 4 or 5 pm you can see the staff parade and that is so?,,,"8108 - stayed for a weekend, complained several times about the AC wasn't cold, tried to change room but same situation.   The hallways are too warm because they closed everything, no air coming in or out, such a waste of cool batu air, should make it into railings instead of glass and concrete at the ends of your hallway, such a waste!   Room is quite warm in the afternoon, and all the cold air disappears once you open the doors to the hallway.. Pool was quite dirty on a Tuesday night and no sign that it was closed at 8, but several staff keeps telling me to get out of the pool? why?   Bar closes at 21.30, seriously? why bother having a bar if you close at 21.30?  Restaurant, they closed till the 6th of January back when I stayed at the 4th, but room service was available, I?"
"You started off with entering the zoo. Here you'll find your regular animals (tigers, lions, leopards, etc) to unique never seen before such as giant rats. Then as you go enter, they'll transition into a theme park where you can enjoy free rides. Lots of pictures spots. You can?",,,,This place is near from my home at my hometown. First time I came to this place 2 years ago and I did with my family. Because we did in the evening so not all place I can visited.   And last June I did again to visit this place with my friend. We explore this place 6 hours.?,,,"I stayed here for 2 nights. And will read further reviews for major service and dining improvements before I will stay here again.   Location wise, there was very little one could find fault with. The layout of the hotel encouraged exploration and the view was really nice on a clear day.   But, the service was poor. First, I was told that there was no more extra bed and therefore I had to book a new room. So naturally I did not and asked for extra blanket and pillow, instead. Guess what? The extra blanket and pillow were chargeable. So off I marched to the receptionist to complain and an extra bed was delivered right away. Hang on. Did you not say earlier that there was not any extra bed???  Second, I had the worst dining experience for a hotel with this many stars. Plates were?"
"This is the best zoo i ever seen. okay, i mean the best if you compared this with taman safari zoo and ragunan zoo, right. i really like the way they're being creative to make the design. it's huge, but you won't be boring. too bad, not long after i came, it started raining. yet?",,,,This was an amazing museum. The best part was actually being able to get into the cars or on the bikes and feel part of the history of the cars etc. Incredibly well done . We could have spent 2 days here and not appreciated everything.,,,"Pro :  - Great photo spots - Good location - Wide area allows further expansion/additional facilities - New nicely designed buildings - I strongly believe a lot can be improved  Cons : - Management was not ready. Service OBVIOUSLY can be improved.      - TL-DR; waited 2 hours just because of an extra bed.         Arrived 1 hour early and had to wait at 2pm to check in - fair enough. Tried to check in at 2 but only 1 ready (booked 2 rooms). Waited for another 10-15mins and was told that room was ready but still waiting to set the extra bed so we decided to go ahead to the ready room first. Waited for another 15 mins still no progress. Our booked rooms were connecting rooms, so we knew that the next room was ours too. Asked a housekeeping guy nearby to check the room. Turns out?"
Lots of animals to see but was raining and lots of slippery areas animals did not look stimulated and sad poor condition for them ,,,,First time to Batu and Jatim Park. I though this is the best part of Jatim Park. You'll be surprised how big the property is. Many classics cars and bikes. There were fighter planes and trains too. Do not miss it. ,,,"Our most unpleasant ""5-star"" hotel experience. Though claimed to be a 5-star hotel, this hotel doesn't deserve its 5-star rate. This hotel felt more like a 3 or maybe a 2 star hotel ?  Pro: 1. New building, new facilities. 2. Big Swimming Pool and a decent kids playing area, good if you bring children up to 10 years old.   Cons: 1. Lack of staffs, and even with a limited number of staffs they all felt lackluster and lazy.  2. Buffet Restaurant and Room Service. The food quality and variety are NOT 5-star hotel. The food that are supposed to be warm at the breakfast and dinner buffet (Branche Rest) are cold !! Also you will see lots of flies in the restaurant. I ordered a Club Sandwich from the room service, the bread was very dry and so thick, so sad. Restaurant (Branche) food?"
"I'm so amazed by Batu Secret Zoo. The place is beautiful, the animals so taken care, they don't look starving.

To spend time with family . Friend , and loved .",,,Modern hotel with nice breakfast. Room design is very nice and the housekeeping done the job properly. We can relax in the jacuzzi after swimming. There is basement parking so we dont need to worry during rains. Will visit again next time. 
"Compare to any other Zoo, even in other countries... this is the best. with one price we can see all the experience including ""small and enjoyable life safari with animal beside us""  and the price also very affordable A Must see program while you are in Malang ",,,,"Extensive collection of cars and other forms of transportation justified the high (for Indonesia) admission price. I was particularly pleased to see an Ontario Provincial Police cruiser (sixties, I'd say) and Chrysler Windsor Deluxe, both of which reminded me of home. ",,,"This is my second time here. I booked from online site 2 months previsit. And i had called 3 times to make sure our special needs fulfilled. They were saying done. But when we arrived everything isnt done. I had to repeat my reques because they dont know (or dont want to know) and some are not fulfilled. They dont even apologize for it (not even saying sorry instead defend theirself) The room is very spacy and elegant. They have balcon at every room. Before, i'm surprissed that they gave me 2 keys each room. But they gave that with purpose because everytime you take elevator you have to scan your roomkey. AND even when we had breakfast they scanned your key. No key no breakfast i think. The pool is very nice with playground pool, hot water pool, and main pool with big slide. But?"

Hope they add more on local?",,,"The hotel design is modern, the bed is comfortable and quite sizeable.  We stayed in a premier room so the bathtub is a hit with the kids.  It's quite pricey though for Malang standard.  The kiddie water playground is great.  The pool is nice too, but it would be better if it is heated.  The water is very cold.   The food can be improved.  The first breakfast we had was at the lobby level and the choices are quite minimal with average quality.  I had high hopes for at least the bread / pastry selection since I heard the hotel is affiliated with the famous Holland Bakery, but the bread/pastry section was quite bare.  The second breakfast we had in the restaurant was better, more choices.  Not sure if it was because it was the weekend or if the hotel put less choices at that lobby?"
Quite disappointed. Not as great as being told by others. The animals are not complete and some of it looks have been abondoned for awhile. Too crowed even on the weekdays. Not recommended if you have kids.,,,,"I don't know how to describe this, is this a museum or a amusement park? they have the qualities..   you need to spare a whole day tour in this museum, however, they open at mid day, so i suggest you to have lunch before entering the museum.   you are not allowed to bring food?",,,"No other hotel like this one in Batu. Realy outstanding in term of comfort, breakfast, and friendly of staff.  Fascilities has not completed yet, but it has been fun for kids.

Since I was traveling with an infant, timely service was much expected. After waiting around 45mins, we finally got our key and went straight to the room. However, the key didn't work. The bellboy who brought our luggages had to go back to the receptionist to get a new key. Again, we were left waiting for a long time at the corridor. How annoying. In there, I noticed the corridor floor & even the glass window were dusty. It was obvious that?"

We were not told about dinner compliment available during check in at 1pm, d dinner was over at 10pm. That was one. The second one, we wanted to use the dinner coupon given by the receptionist the day before but was told the dinner coupons were invalid, surprised rite? Then why were we given the coupons?
