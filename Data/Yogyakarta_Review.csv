"Me, my mom, and a friend of mine visited this site in Nov 2019. I have always wanted to visit Borobudur. I hired a taxi guide to go here, I think others may rent cars or use public transportation.   We arrived around 11 AM, the temperature was already very warm. We bought some?",Amazing historic site to visit if you go to Yogyakarta.  Seeing the history that is present after so many years was breathtaking.,"Taman Sari Complex is one of the historical and cultural heritage tourism sites in Yogyakarta. Taman Sari Complex is nicknamed as the Water Palace. It is located southwest of the Yogyakarta Palace. Historically, the Taman Sari was built as a garden and a bathing place for the?",We took up the offer of a guide (included in the entry price) which I would recommend. She was very informative and of course friendly as are all people from Yogyakarta! There is a shop attached although it doesn?t have a huge range.  You are not allowed to take photos in the museum. If you?re interested in the history of batik then I highly recommend this museum.?,Experienced the local shopping at the night with family. Prices are low and so many options for shopping and food and malls. ,"Staying at Artotel Yogyakarta really makes me satisfied with the comfort and services provided, with an atmosphere filled with modern artistic style that makes me even more fascinated, because it makes me feels like I was in inside a cool hotel and museum. The view of the rooms in studio 41 that overlooks Mount Merapi directly, truly spoil the eyes and refresh the mind. One thing that I regret at Artotel Yogyakarta, why is the swimming pool is only small in size and close to the Roca Bar, Me personally think it is less comfortable when there are people who are eating exposed to splashes of water swimming. Thank you for the whole nine yards about a good services you provided us.","I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. This hotel is one of my favourite hotel, why? Because the staff are very kind and friendly. Especially Mr. Wawan and Mr. Winanda they treat us like a family. The other reason why i choose this hotel because they follow the protocol of covid-19 and the hotel was so cleaned   Above all Thank you to Grand Ambarrukmo team!","I have stayed in this Marriott since it first opened and become my top choice in Yogyakarta.  I like the room design, M club lounge, and most important their GOOD SERVICE.  Marriott Yogyakarta is the best hotel in town !!!"
Seeing the chained up elephants at the end of the trip ruined the entire day. We would not have entered the park had we known these elephants would be there. Why are these elephants needed at the park? Do the right thing and hand them over to animal rescue. How can you teach?,"I usually use my bicycle to explore this area. The temple grounds are huge and well maintained. Really love this one, a beautiful place to visit and take some pictures, especially at morning.",Beautiful architecture! Went in the rainy season but still was stunning to see. Best bit was actually roaming about the streets around the Tamansari and seeing the locals living in the royal area. ,"Went in to do a 2-hour batik workshop and it ended up taking almost 3, but the time flew by! It was really fun and a good challenge, I have a newfound respect for the batik makers now! We started by choosing our design, which was pencil-drawn on cloth. Then we sat with our cloth and the tool to scoop up the wax and use the wax to trace over the pencil design. We were able to watch a woman with years of experience work on a product with tracing perfection.  She fixed our wax when we finished so that was nice :).  After that, we used dyes and paintbrushes to color in the design, the wax ensuring the colors stayed within their area. Once they dried, we painted the backs with some sealer ooze and let them dry. Since I had to go, the batik museum completed my masterpiece for me and I picked it up at the 24/7 lobby of the batik hotel in the same parking lot, nicely folded and packaged.   To schedule, call Mrs. Isti at +62-822-4461-1883. You can also do the full 4-5 hour workshop to complete your personal batik from start to finish!?","Get to experience the local food, see the busy street of Jogja and shop till i drop. This is where to buy souvenirs from friends and family.","I got a gift from my friends to stay in this hotel. And thats amazing experience i?ve ever had.

Definitely will consider staying here again in the future!"
"Sunrise in Borobudur temple.  Mystical place full of history, beautiful but always crowded both at sunrise and sunset.  If you are in Indonesia it is a must .. to visit without doubts","Prambanan temple is one of the famous temple in Indonesia. Located in Sleman, Klaten, it gives you experience to explore Roro Jonggrang legend.  <U+0001F697>How to get here?

Temple of Roro?","It was an okay visit, perhaps not as nice as the one in Bali, but still quite pretty.  It is a rather small venue, and you can be done within the hour.  There is a separate underground mosque, which can be reached via another tunnel.  It should be done together with a visit to?","I?ve been to this museum several times for guiding friends, and I still enjoy it. with UNESCO declares Batik as Indonesia cultural heritage in 2001 and also World Cultural Council chooses Yogyakarta as Batik City in 2014, I think add more to fancy people buying Batik whenever coming to Yogyakarta, and for that, I always recommend visiting this museum, at least to know the history of Batik, types, and its evolution. imo, it is always nice to appreciate using Batik when knowing its history and how hard making it. one of their collections is also registered in MURI (the Indonesia World Records Museum)  another uniqueness of this museum is that it?s a family-owned batik museum which was opened since 1979, and it?s located on the same compound with their hotel. the grandson acts as the guide, and he really has great knowledge about Batik. the museum was started by his grands, Mr. Hadi Nugroho & R. Ng. Jumima Dewi Sukaningsih. Visitors can try fabric dyeing around 1 hour with the price of 40.000 IDR and can be as your souvenir. many my friends, especially the foreigner ones enjoy that activity and back home they framed their own result.   TIPS: if wish to get better explanation in English, you better call first the museum and hoping to have available guide in English. You might be lucky to have the grandson.?",The sell all kind of local stuffs here. Come here on the last day of your trip if you want to get souvenirs for your family or friends. The stores were also negotiable and be smart with your negotiation!,Nice and comfortable room. Nice ambient and art installation. Breakfast was good and tasty.  Thanks for good hospitality to all staff especially front desk Julia. Keep up the good work! Artotel Yogya..,After months in Bali in our house during  the Corona Pandemic we decided to travel to Yogya and Solo for a few days. Having stayed at the Grand Ambarrukmo Hotel before we immediately felt like coming home even though a number of the team members of the past were not working there anymore.  We got a double room on the 5th floor at the far end which is slightly bigger than the normal rooms however this comes with a higher price. As the room on the fifth floor is on the same level as the swimming pool and the gym spending the extra money is worthwhile. A new addition to the hotel is a covered very well designed passage bridge across the very busy main  road to the adjacent shopping center with its many shops and a great variety of different restaurants. The bedroom like all other?,"Today i was checked out from Marriott Yogyakarta. This  my 3rd times stayed at Marriott Yogyakarta.

"On 9th March 2020 I visited Borobudur Temple Complex, which was one of my highlights in my tour itinerary. Though my visit was planned for the afternoon my guide switched to the morning as it was cooler. Besides, rain was forecasted in the afternoon. So best time to visit is in?",One of the main sites in Central Java. Fantastic stone carvings that depict mythical Hindu tales. Temple date back to 900 AD.,"My Friends and I went to Taman Sari on 12th January 2020. We arrived there at noon and the place was very crowded. But, we still enjoy this place by taking photos together because this place was very nice.","Definitely the place to come before you buy any batik in order to understand the process, meaning and colours of batik. It was completely deserted when I went and I had two guides take me around.","Walkable sideways, clean, lots of hand wash equipment, clear map with historical explanation. Lots of improvement compare to the old malioboro road","stayed here for couple of times. What i like the most here is the interior design, its super cute and very instagram worthy <U+0001F929> i have some trouble prior staying but the staffs were so nice and helpful. Some improvements needed on the parking space, because its quite small. Overall its always pleasant to stay here.","I have been in this hotel several times. This hotel is one of my favourite hotels in Yogya. Good location. Just across the street, you will find Ambarukmo Plaza mall. Reception staff, Mr Wawan was so friendly. Health protocol was well operated at this hotel, even at restaurant during breakfast. All restaurant staff used mask and faceshields. You may not touch or pick the food and drinks. All must be taken by the staff. Fried rice and croissants were very ok.  Comfortable bedroom.  Above all, many thanks to Mrs Retno. Gbu","Last week i was stayed @ Yogyakarta Marriott Hotel for second times. They Staff very humble, attention to the guest needs and friendly.

"its about an hour drive from our hotel in Yogyakarta City, the temple was big and well kept, it gets really busy with tourist obviously, but it is very understandable since it is indeed a UNESCO world heritage. You can feel the calming atmosphere despite with the crowd","Ok, look this temple is wonderful, don?t get me wrong. But I?m a woman who?s traveling alone. And yes I?m white and I?m from Europe. It?s 2020, so this is not that special. I was walking around the temple area and the locals really annoying me with secretly making photos of me.?","Nice places with authentic buildings nice for photography, spending more time here with my friend since a lot of people is during school break then we are need to wait till the main water fountain clear with people.. ",Great collection of batik and stamps. The museum seems a little old but you will see the guide is excellent. Her english was very good and she even knew some french. She taught me a lot about how to create and wear batik.,"Here there are many musical performances, where to eat, where to play, and also a place to have fun. please be careful here because there are many fraudulent acts.","Creative wall art design and golden slide..homey room and restaurant.. cool swimming pool just like at home..humble and friendly staffs, highly recommended for family holiday, office gathering - Zulia, Angga, Neta","I stayed at the hotel for one night. But one thing that I remember is I had several zoom-meetings that day. That is why the wifi connection was a crucial factor. I had no expectation about it previously. However, it turned out that all of my meetings went well without any signal trouble.  I stayed in Jogja because I accompanied my husband who visited his project there. Since I spend many times alone, I decided to strolled in Ambarrukmo Plaza. the connecting bridge helped me out much. I do not need to worry in crossing the busy road between the mall and the hotel.  And the last factor which made me happy was the hotel concerned about covid19 protocols. They gave me a package consisted of a hand sanitizer, a gloves, and a mask. At the restaurant, they put food in separate plates so?","Huge and beautiful room  Sadly, towels smell like cigarette!! Awful. We asked for the change of towels but they remain the same awful cigarette smell. The only difference was strong or weak smell of smoke. Unsure if the staffs were smoking while doing laundry.  Irony was the hotel has strict rules of not having more than 2 people in the room, even though there are limit of people imposed during breakfast time, it appeared to be over crowded in our personal view  Good selection of breakfast. Taste wise is just average. However, waffle n the ice cream taste really good.   Hope they do something about the laundry and perhaps watching out on breakfast crowd more strictly "
"This temple is enormous! There is a garden around the temple. Surf around and you will eventually reach the temple. At the temple, the views were amazing no matter from the bottom or the top of the temple. There carvings are so incredible that it has got its own meaning along the?","Hinduism is based on the concept of cycles of creation, preservation and destruction. This temple complex is dedicated to the three representative Gods viz., Brahma the creator (left spire facing), Vishnu the preserver (right spire) and Shiva the destroyer (center main spire).?",Worth a visit in order to see how the daily life of the Royal family was. Usually full of people but interesting!,"Seems to be the official Batik Museum. Located away from the tourist area.  While you can get to know about the process some, the main goal seems to be to seel batiks to you.","Malioboro is the place you should go wonder and experience to go when in Jogjakarta. It?s shoulder to shoulder ambiance w things to see, shop, eat and listen to music while you do all. If lucky enough you get to to eat and concert in the front row. Enjoy and experience it.

However, it?s my second visit to this hotel and the pillowcase smells bad that?s always disappoint me. Even though  they had already changed the pillow but it still smells. "
It was very interesting the stone carving was amazing. If you want a guide you must use the site guide and pay extra. Good visit but after Anchor Wat nothing compares. It was so hot we could not see the whole thing and the steps are way higher than normal with also no hand rails.?,This was also on our bucket list and we were delighted to be able to visit this place.    The temple buildings are spread across a large compound and they have restored around five buildings.  They are truly impressive and you cannot help but have a sense of awe and wonder. ?,"tamansari is very close to my house but never get bored to visit this place since this place is very beautiful...we can get some food stall also nearby there,prices are cheap and the taste is just awesome..","Wherever you go in the streets of Jogia you get hundreds of people shouting ""batik"" ""batik "" at you.

This was right up our street as you get fed up of?","The road was closed on our first visit. It was full of local tourists. It is a good place to watch how people pose for their photos.

"Stay nearby, and go in the morning or evening to avoid the heat. Prices are fair. But get a guide to show you the reliefs and explain all the intricacies you would miss if you were not an expert on the site and history.",We visited the Prambanan after we have been to the Borobudur. We had a guide who explained a lot about the history but his English was not very good. Nevertheless a nice visit but not that impressive. Not to be missed when you visit Java.,This was probably the only place worth the visit. Be sure to take a local guide for 50k rupiah as it will be enlightening. Unfortunately the surrounding areas have been claimed for private dwellings otherwise it would be brilliant. ,"Small, privately run museum with impressive collection of historic batiks and batik patterns both from Yogyakarta and Solo as well as coastal Java.","We walked here from outer hotel near the Tugu. It was not hot, being evening, and there were hordes of visitors, and we were not spending much time here as we were not shopping for clothes, that being the most popular thing to buy. Instead we shopped in an oleh-oleh shop, of which?","Stayed for two months, January-February 2020.  Staff were friendly and helpful. Rates reasonable, room sufficiently clean and comfortable. Located in a safe part of town, bustling at all hours of the day with many nearby eateries (including fast food), including 24 hour shops such as restaurants, cafes, and pharmacies. Also a post office within 3 minutes  walking distance.  Some reviews mentioned walls are thin, and noise is a problem. Walls are indeed thin - loud conversations may be heard by adjacent rooms easily. But this did not bother me too much during my stay, I never lost any sleep in 2 months over this. Stayed on the seventh floor, barely any noise from traffic. Was not bothered by noise from weekend events at the hotel bar, despite having my room window overlook it. ?","The experience of staying at the Grand Amambarrukmo hotel is quite impressive even though it is only a one-night transit in the city of Jogja. The service from the staff on duty is very very friendly and feels warm. Starting from the check-in process, breakfast until check-out the staff are quite informative. Room condition is clean and neat. And happened to get a room on the top floor, so you can see the beauty of the city of Jogja at night through the window of the room. Breakfast is also delicious and quite varied. Thank you very much to Mas Awan, who gave us recommendations for some places to eat that night. I am very appreciative because indeed we do not know many places to eat that are recommended in Jogja. Thank you Grand Ambarrukmo. Always be success.","It is such a great place to stay. The hotel located in a strategic place, and close to the mall. Their service are very good that they provide anything i need. They also provide a great food for breakfast.  Their facilities such as pool and gym are also great."
Great heritage place. Impressive temple. Cheap but quality guide service. Reasonable entrance ticket price. Worth visit. Just need to hold your nerves when searching main gate walking through thousands stalls with gifts and annoying sellers,"Where Borobudur is huge, this Temple complex is vast! Beautiful, clean and Well managed. Very impressive temple towers and reliefs. Go early before crowds and heat and be prepared for a long walk as the complex is very spread out. But lots to see, not just Temples.","I think this place is epic. It built more than 2 centuries ago but it still stand firm. Tourist will need a guide to surround this place. The guide can take photos of you too. For those who bring camera, you will need to pay extra charge for it.","Yogyakarta Batik Museum is located directly next to the Hotel Museum Batik.

Near by to Adi Sucipto airport, Ambarukmo Mall and plenty of local restaurants around the hotel..",I stayed here for business meeting. The room was spacious and comfort.

"Impressive temple complex that was hidden, very nice to visit and walk around at the complex in peace and respect","I went to visit this temple on 31 January 2020. From Surabaya, it took about 4 hours and 30 minutes by private car. The admission ticket for domestic tourist: adult Rp. 50.000 and Kids Rp. 25.000.  Many souvenir and food stalls after exit, but still in the area of Prambanan.?",An interesting building. Looks like it needs some much needed maintenance. Great place to take some photos.,"Most of the Souvenir are very interested and the price is fair. But they can not speak English Language. They always say Javanese Language. Other wise, they made fixed price whatever you want and need or something like that.","This trip is not my first to Malioboro Road, i must say that its the heart of yokja. its laid back with normal city life.

Keep up the good work and thanks for your hospitality :)  _Agnes_","We stayed at Grand Ambarukmo Hotel Jogjakarta for 2 nights and experienced the impeccable hospitality. From the very first time we stepped into this hotel smiles from all the employees never cease until the last day we stepped out.  And to make it even better they threw a sweet little surprise for me since they knew the 1st day we checked in was my birthday. Is not that sweet. The next day, we needed some little stuff when packing up, and those little stuff they even provided. To us there is only one word describes this place : SATISFYING. Will sure come and stay here on our next trip, and will also recommend this Grand Ambarukmo to our family and friends.

Do not miss it!  The guides are very well informed and you will learn a great deal about batik.,"Good shopping, and clean modern streets. The only thing lacking is decent street food.

My nephew ordered ?Green Tea? while he was expecting ?Matcha?.

Its always better to be there early morning. Sunrise can be seen from the temple and it is an incredble sight.

If you plan to stay here, I suggest you to take some pictures in front of some artsy walls.  There is also live music at M floor in 2 of the 3 nights of my stay here (Friday and Saturday night).  Not to mention, this hotel is also family friendly. I saw many people bring their child to play at the pool.

And we choose the floor with the same floor as the swimming pool that is at the 5th floor. Actually, our first choice is at Royal Ambarrukmo, but unfortunately, we do not get the room that we choose.

Using Suite Award, one of the room was upgraded with a connecting room. The rooms are fantastic. I guess partly the hotel overall is fairly new.  Why I am giving this only a 3 star is because of couple of things :  1) The M Lounge - I do not think it lives up to Marriott Lounge Standard. This looks like Courtyard by Marriott at MOST. I have enjoyed a better service of Courtyard By Marriott in India - Yes, India, Not Indonesia.  2) Some of the staff, does not behaves like serving guests in 5* Marriott. Sorry to say, this is not even hitting the basic of 5*. This is especially at the back office. Ther are fairly arrogant to spell out the ground rules - Is that how they treat someone who gives 100?"

The hotel is in a very good location, adjacent to the Hartono Mall which I think is one of the bigger shopping malls in Yogyakarta.   Hotel staff were all very friendly and quick to smile and help. What I like about hotels here in Asia is that they acknowledge you for being a Marriott elite member. Even being Silver back in the?"

Swimming pool also good. They have kids pool and adult pool. Fitness room was nice. The club lounge was ok with free drinks. But the food and snack was until 8.00 pm only (I think this should be reconsidered by the management). Location was good... just beside the hartono mall (the biggest mall in jogja).

Then we were shown to our adjoining rooms for our two night stay and I was glad to see that the rooms were exactly like the pictures. The rooms were big, comfortable and luxurious.

The bath tub is enormous and one could enjoy a bath while enjoying the sunset!  Food at the kitchen is average and probably can be improved upon but the choices is plentiful.  The Quan Spa is very good. Marriott members get discount of 10% to 20%, depending on the category of membership.   I enjoyed my stay very much and would highly recommend it. "

Our first impressions during the first stay were reconfirmed during the second stay: this is a great hotel for business people, holiday makers and weekenders to feel comfortable and well cared for.

The staff are some of the best staff I have ever encountered. Very professional and hospitable. When you ask for something or request a service you get it. There is no asking twice. Housekeepers keep your room exceptionally clean.    The gym and pool are very nice for a city hotel and are actually better than gyms and pools at some big resorts. My only complaint is the pool closes too early. It would be nice to swim at night, especially if you are in Yogyakarta for work?"

The room also very nice and modern. I like the carpet in their room corridor. Look so art and lux. They have a lounge and a ballroom in the same floor with swimming pool view. Perfect for wedding or gathering event. I will surely recommend this hotel to my colleague.,"Loved the facilities, very clean and modern. The buffet breakfast was amazing with so many choices. We loved our stay. The only detail why it was not perfect was due to the loud sounds from the nearby mosque that woke us up around 4 am but I guess this would be the case in almost all Yogya.
