She was very informative and of course friendly as are all people from Yogyakarta! There is a shop attached although it doesn’t have a huge range.  You are not allowed to take photos in the museum.

The temple grounds are huge and well maintained. Really love this one, a beautiful place to visit and take some pictures, especially at morning.","Beautiful architecture! Went in the rainy season but still was stunning to see. Best bit was actually roaming about the streets around the Tamansari and seeing the locals living in the royal area. ","Went in to do a 2-hour batik workshop and it ended up taking almost 3, but the time flew by! It was really fun and a good challenge, I have a newfound respect for the batik makers now! We started by choosing our design, which was pencil-drawn on cloth. Then we sat with our cloth and the tool to scoop up the wax and use the wax to trace over the pencil design. We were able to watch a woman with years of experience work on a product with tracing perfection.  She fixed our wax when we finished so that was nice :).  After that, we used dyes and paintbrushes to color in the design, the wax ensuring the colors stayed within their area. Once they dried, we painted the backs with some sealer ooze and let them dry. Since I had to go, the batik museum completed my masterpiece for me and I picked it up at the 24/7 lobby of the batik hotel in the same parking lot, nicely folded and packaged.   To schedule, call Mrs. Isti at +62-822-4461-1883.
