It costs 1250 K IDR for the waterfall and adventure package - which is what you should do.   There are a lot of uneven steps down to the falls and jumps so it is not for the unfit or mobility impaired.  The…,Rooms were great. Just what you need for a place to hide away after you explore Kuta. Close to beach. Security at the hotel is incredible and Septi and Ari made sure we were well looked after. Always kind and welcoming.,"My girlfriend Rita and me spent 2 weeks in this fabulous hotel. They were so kind as to give us a free upgrade for a suite for the time of our stay which was a very generous offer, and the staff truly tried to fulfill all of our wishes in an instant. Especially Darma and Ari from the front desk were extremely helpful and friendly. You get 5* service, many waiters and waitresses greet you by your name after a while. We really felt at home <U+0001F3E1> there. Breakfast was amazing, it’s not a buffet but you’re full for the whole day from it. Definitely need to try the Chef’s Special and the Soft Shell Crab <U+0001F980>.  Afternoon tea at the pool is superb, and the whole place is just minutes from the beach. These two weeks passed by as if they were just seconds. Will definitely go back there next…","It's hard to just say a few good things about this place as after spending 7 days here with my girlfriend in march.  The heart and soul of this place is the staff, more attentive, customer service minded and helpful staff is hard to find even in Bali. Ega at the reception and Reana at the restaurant bar shined a little extra. That being said ALL of the staff were absolutely amazing.   The rooms? We had the suite and boy was it worth it. A huge balcony going around our room, with the most insane view of the ocean. Massive room with a great bed and aircon.   The restaurants were great and we ate here almost everyday because of the lockdown and Nyepi.   Location is also amazing if you plan on going to Omnia (the hotel has deals) or Sunday beach club.   This is a real 5 star and…"
"This is such a beautiful temple. It’s really big, and there’s such a peaceful atmosphere to walking around. We were there during a ceremony, which was so special to see too.

You can trekking with a really low ticket price but if you're going to swim and jump down the waterfalls, you're gonna need a local guide with a price that is a higher, but trust me it's worthy.","Friendly and accomodating staff. Septi from the reception and Adi, one of the servers most especially.  On our second day, I requested for yogurt and granola (which was one of the main courses the previous day) but it wasn't available. (The hotel changes their main course menu every two days.) I appreciate that Adi checked the kitchen for me and when it wasn't available, he promised that he'll, have yogurt and granola ready for me the next morning. And he delivered. I really appreciate it.  I love that breakfast menu is concentrated on local dishes too, letting the guests have a taste of Indonesian cuisine.   The beds are comfy too. Water pressure and temperature is good. The only downside for me is that the lighting in the room was quite dim so it was a little challenging when…","I have traveled around the world since retiring ten years ago, and during that time have stayed at dozens of hotels from Cape Town, the Caribbean, Dubai, Hong Kong, South East Asia,  and all points in between, and I can honestly say that this hotel stands out as one of the very best I have experienced..it is brand new, the rooms are luxurious and spacious with over-sized comfortable beds and large flat screen TV's with cable and include nice touches like installed water softeners.

The spa treatment was really nice as well. Wangi did a great job. And Handre at breakfast was so nice. Overall, it was wonderful stay, highly recommend!"

They said ok to every request we made. They got us extra towels, let us store our bags late, found us umbrellas, did our laundry, got us all kind of special breakfast items. They wrote us a hand-written note to apologize. What !?! I can't thank Septi, Grace and Gusti enough. Thanks for the umbrella at night Tina! Thank you Angur!

As people have pointed out, the rooms are on the smaller side but the service and dedication of the staff at this hotel more than makes up for everything!","We had a fantastic stay at the Amnaya Benoa Resort hotel. The service is great all the time. The rooms are very spacious and well furnished with nice amenities and everything working (TV, airco etc.). The food and breakfast were great. A nice pool, nothing too big, but normally also not too busy because of the relative hotel size. Nice smells everywhere and clean.  Special thanks to Arnawa for his personal service.","I stayed here for 2 days in March 2020. All of the staff were excellent, very kind and accommodating. Location was good, close to a couple of beaches and the Uluwatu Temple. They also offer a free shuttle service (though I was unable to use it due to the nCoV closing down these spots).

Only thing, there’s not so many places to go outside the hotel.  Beach not good, dirty. ","Very nice resort that is suitable for both couples and families. As all resorts it’s not very personal though, and do not eat at the restaurants. Breakfast was good and a lot to choose from. Great gym and yoga! Pool area was awesome and the staff in the pool bar as well. Rest of the service was meh. Would not go again but that is based on the fact that it is a resort. Great for everyone who likes lying by the pool. Awesome area in Uluwatu, close to take a Grab or Gojek to all good restaurants. Uluwatu is NOT good for sunbathing. "
"I had heard of a lot of harassment faced by tourists by the locals of this area. However, things are not the same anymore.

The two restaurants are great and the buffet breakfast change every day which is good if you are staying a week or more.  The pool area is amazing and the staff are all fantastic. Would surely stay there again if I am in Bali. 
It's difficult to predict the weather however it would be a huge bonus if you go when the sky is blue and no clouds. That would help to see the Mt Agung which would make the trip even more special.,"No stay in Ubud would be complete without a trip to its famous Monkey Forest, the name alone sparks the imagination. Its goal of preserving a forested area peppered with traditional buildings and temples all for the purposes of protecting hundreds of families of monkeys is a…","As a result of tourism, the beach is a rubbish tip each morning.

The only negative…",I read lots of conflicting info about this place so I thought I’d let you know the drill.  It is about 15 minutes drive out of Lovina up in to the hills. When you arrive there is a small carpark and a reception area. To enter the waterfall area unaccompanied it is RP20k (AUD$2)…,This place is customer orientated and it makes a huge difference. The staff are friendly and hard working. Breakfast is amazing. Rooms are clean and functional. Grandma's makes for a comfortable stay in Kuta. ,"Absolutely superb hotel! It looks and feels amazing but the staff here make it truly special! From the first greeting when you arrive to every single encounter after they have all been so friendly and attentive.  We had two very minor issues (small leak in shower and mix up with hiring bicycles) and the staff went above and beyond what would be considered necessary to rectify these. The emphasis on customer satisfaction is outstanding!  We enjoyed a couple's Tropical Fruit treatment from the spa and this was fantastic. It lasted 2hours and was tailored to our personal preferences. Again, the staff were brilliant and we would both highly recommend this.  A special thank you to Arnawa who was a brilliant member of the team, very friendly and helpful.","This is a fabulous property with nice big rooms and lots of storage space. We were slightly disappointed with the selection of items in the buffet breakfast and the bread toaster was always burning the toast because the bread was jammed in it.

Attentive, polite, with excellent English. Rooms are large and the beds are extremely comfortable. Pool is fabulous. Special mention for Widi, Adit and Desy at the Filini Italian restaurant.   Visited Some of the local beaches and they were extremely disappointing. Difficult to get to, often dangerous steps and, when you get there, very few facilities."

I loved the big bathtub! - Good selection at breakfast (eggs, Asian dishes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, meat, bread, sweets, and cheese--though adding some oatmeal would be nice!) - Large pool and lush territory with lots of flowers and greenery. You'll be able to hear frogs at night and maybe even see a monkey hanging in the trees on the edge of the property! - Great location close to some beautiful beaches and powerful surf. Also lots of great restaurants nearby! - Daily shuttle to Uluwatu temple for the fire dance - Complimentary drinks and snacks…"
If you like seeing temples you have to see this temple. Situated high up in the mountain and a view to kill for from the top. Mother of all temples <U+0001F600>,"So fun! The monkeys will only get irritated if you get too close to them, so just don't bother them and they won't bother you.

Go a bit north And the Beach is Wider and better in Many Ways! As Well as the Waves!,"A hardish trek mainly due to time of the night and humidity and the speed of the guide who wanted to sprint up.

Beautiful materials and design. Rooms 5 star look-a- like. Food is amazing so is the fantastic spa. Swimming-pool an oasis and you’ll love views in room regarding the build of all furniture and balconies. ,"It is with a heavy heart that I leave this review as this place could be amazing if it wasn't for numerous hiccups...  The pool and architecture is amazing and staff in general were friendly but why this would never be a five start resort are: - The aircon is not efficient, after several call outs it is clear that the system does not go colder than 24 despite having a control in the room.  Also miscommunication between in that were promised a better room to compensate for this but that never realised. - No one to help with luggage with arriving - 20min to check-in - Soap no being replaced by house keeping when cleaning the room - Bacon and other hot food items being cold during breakfast It could seem that the above is pettiness but one would expect better of 5* and Radisson Blu."

This was a holiday where I got to see the generous spirit and peaceful happiness this beautiful culture possess.  The Radisson Blu Uluwatu was such a relaxing venue and the dtaff went above and beyond.  We were SO relaxed a couple of hours after arriving!  We floated in the pool and enjoyed pizza and happy hour.  We have never been more relaxed in our adult lives. The scenery from this part of Bali is nothing short of spectacular.

The only downside was that there's no pool, but the staff were very helpful in directing us to the one nearby that costs a small amount to visit. We didn't take advantage of all the services the hotel has to offer, but it offers a lot for travelers who want to just relax and stay in all day, and travelers like us who really only came back to sleep. The location is perfect, not too close to the ""crazy loud party"" area of town, but near a lot of spas and eateries. We'd happily stay here again next time we're in the area.","Amnaya Resorts Benoa Nusa Dua The place is incredible the tranquility calming effect  The interior and exterior are incredible design very artistic amazing love it  The staffs are great service, friendly polite and helpful  Very clean and fresh the foods is absolutely delicious   and healthy options fruits is given everyday into your room and in the morning breakfast so much foods   you don’t feel like having lunch or so through the day I’m more energetic because of all the foods   And so thoughtful of amenities herbal lotion shampoo conditioner shower gel even salt bath and scrub my skin is so soft and so smooth  all in all was a wonderful experience highly recommended thank you <U+0001F60A>","Very nice place.

"The biggest and most beautifulltemple on Bali, still very impressive on the location. And now everything was well organised, no agressive salesman. Stop at 1 km before the entrance, parking, buy a ticket with a FREE sarong and we were brought to the entrance, 1 km on the…","When we visited Bali, one of us was on crutches with a broken ankle. This made ALL tourist attractions very difficult and tiring to navigate.

We stayed at this hotel from the 6-10 February 2020 Amazing hotel and service they have a really good breakfast! which my grandmother really loved! Along with that Puspita, Yodi and Dedi from the breakfast restaurant were very helpful since we had a 3 year old child travelling with us and cannot wake up early for breakfast they packed some food for her.  Although just a suggestion, maybe if you guys would consider one day... would've been a lot better actually if the restaurant also serves lunch and dinner as well since they have really good food.  And i would like to thank Steel from housekeeping department as well for making those cute towel…","This hotel will not disappoint . From the time you walk in the ambiance in this hotel hits you . Beautifully designed, nothing left out. The rooms are huge , king bed, dinning area, outside lounge on balcony and the bed is amazing , pillows are huge and fluffy!! The bath is amazing to lay back and have a long soak , with bath salts and bubble bath sitting on a tray with a loafer .. the bathroom product all smell Devine ! The pool area and gym are a wow. I have never seen such a well designed gym in Bali . This hotel is a must stay . Cleanest hotel in Bali without a doubt !!",I definitely come back. Spa treatments was best ever. Room was spacious and very comfortable. Views was peaceful and beautiful. I switched a hotel during my stay in Uluwatu because the other hotel was awful. 
We organized our driver to pick us up at 6Am from our Kuta Hotel. This was the best move.           We arived at 7.45Am. Our driver managed to take us up to the top car park as no one else was here. So we didnt have to rent scooters to get to the entry. The entry office for…,A trip to Bali is not complete without visiting these precious monkeys!  Give yourself a lot of time as the sanctuary gets busy!  Don't wear shiney anything (jewelry) as the monkeys will stop at nothing to grab hold of it and not let go.  DO keep your purses closed as they like…,Great place to surf for the beginners. There are tons of surfing schools to choose from. Hopefully you can find the right person.,What an experience! Yes it is an early start if you want to see the sunrise but it is definitely worse the climb. I am not very fit but you just choose your own pace and the place is definitely very spiritual.,We booked the short tour with guide. The jumping and slides are great aswell as the guide. It's obvious that you don't need a guy to find this place but the guy introduce you in the slides and jumping and make sure that you leave after 2.5 hours that the place is not over crowed…,"I had stayed here before this trip but the convenience to eateries shopping and live music is fantastic. Staff extremely happy and helpful, very good breakfast... Will be back in the near future, good ace for us to park our vehicle as well.","I was in Nusa Dua for a conference in one of the big global hotel brands and given my personal preference of staying in less known hotel brands, I was not disappointed.  The service was great and my room (I was automatically upgraded to the room with a bath) had nice touches.  It is just a shame I did not have a chance to enjoy it more.  The staff were very helpful and accommodating.  The only thing I would say is that the library is rather small if one needs an air-conditioned place to work outside the room.  In addition, the room could do with a working space.  But then again, I would say this hotel is not really for business","I can’t say enough- I loved my stay. Gorgeous property and very well kept. The staff were all kind, thoughtful, and attentive. Interesting area with a lot to explore on foot. Huge room and super clean! One of my top/favorite hotels ever. "
"As many reviews say, the entrance is 60.000 which includes guide, entrance and bike ride to the temple... Well non of that is true... The driver of the scooter asks you for a tip for one minute drive, you get there and the people are so pushy to buy stuff that I said I had no…",Bali always has a view to charm its tourists with the nature and its spectacular innocence of how everything is being kept there. If you are scared of monkeys; dont go there. ,One of the famous beach. We had a beach cleaning so far. And it quite fun actually. Especially when we did a positive thing for the mother earth,"Mt. Batur and the lake are very beautiful. That's the only positive thing I could say about that place. If you  want to climb the volcano crater without a guide, the locals will stop you. And they are not very friendly. There is NO official entrance fee, insurance, and any…","The best waterfall I have been to in Bali. Yes you do need to pay as a guide is provided and I think that a guide is important as the main waterfall is sacred and the guide will advise where you can and cannot go. When it comes to the slides, the jumps into the ponds, and access…",Everything was great about the hotel. The rooms are on the small size but is immaculate. The price is amazing. The staff is very friendly. Tina at the front desk is amazing and very helpful. She went above and beyond on everything. The porter was very friendly and was able to answer questions about the area. A+++,"Even though we stayed there only for 3 nights, I can strongly suggest this resort as for its amazing staff as for its structure. The room was outstanding and the restaurant delicious. Hope to come back one day!",The hotel facilities and hotel room are really beautiful. The breakfast is delicious and the staff are very friendly. There is a free shuttle bus to padang padang beach with is great for beginner surfers.

There was no one to monitor it, and so it was fun and beautiful but kind of stressful if you care about the animals. ","Very smelly and dirty, but locals are friendly and local food vendors are soooo yummy, great beginner's surf beach with board hire and lessins being very affordable ",I booked my tour on Viator for the Sunrise Trek through the local Como Bali Tour company.

Agus our driver was great company and made our experience very easy and comfortable. There are a mix of different height waterfalls to jump from (5m/10m/15m). Our guide David was very…,Very good hotel we really enjoyed but they need to improve their break fast item .  Bathroom are ok well maintained  Price was very reasonable. Laundry service also good . Wifi worked perfectly. Their behaviour was so mind blowing ,"This resort exceeded every expectation that my family had prior to checking in. The room was absolutely beautiful not to mention the cool layout for the bathtub and shower. Great toiletries which were topped up daily. The fact that we got upgraded to a junior suite was just an added bonus. The deco for the room for our check-in and my wife's birthday was absolutely splendid.  BEST hotel breakfast I've experienced so far. You get to pick off a set menu which had a sufficient variety of freshly cooked meal for at least a one week.  You get an appetizer, mains, fruits with yogurt, one pastry, coffee/tea, and juice. What's not to like? Thumbs for reducing wastage by not having a typical buffet style breakfast.   Excellent service from the friendly staff as well. They made us feel…",Wow wow wow. What an amazing experience from start to finish. The pool food staff room everything was perfect. Thank you for a memorable experience definitely recommend the Radisson Blu. Can’t wait to return again.

The guide watches your stuff for you and also helps you with the…,"I have stayed here probably 6 or 7 nights in the last six months. I use it for one night transit stays when flying in and out of Bali. For this it is great. Super cheap and a great location on the quieter end of Jalan Legian. Close to shopping and restaurants.  The rooms are basic but it is all thats needed. The rooms on level five can be a little noisy though. There is no restaurant so no room service but these days with GoJek its not really a problem. There is no pool but I have once paid, i think 100k, to use the pool next door. with that payment you get a towel, drink and a meal so really not that bad.  If i was staying longer i would probably stay elsewhere but for this kind of one night stay it is great.  Service has always been very very good.","We decided to stay at this boutique type hotel as it was a change from the usual larger resorts that we have stayed in, in Nusa Dua. The hotel was quirky, new & the architecture was a fusion of modern & traditional.We were given, as requested a quiet room at the back of the hotel & were pleased to be upgraded to an Amnaya room with a bath.The small pool, though located a short distance from the main building & across a common area, was tranquil & aesthetically pleasing & well designed.The restaurant provided a substantial breakfast albeit Indonesian themed. Fussy eaters may find the menu difficult but despite this the meals were beautifully presented & of excellent quality.Throughout the resort the staff were excellent. One day the teas/coffees were not replaced but on request…","Brilliant hospitality, rooms and location. It was a perfect experience for my family and i. Enjoyed every bit of our stay at this hotel. The friendly staff ensured our stay was made comfortable. I plan to come back again."

We did have a problem the first night with street noise but we were moved very easily & quickly to a much quieter area. We also received a lovely apology note and gift. The breakfast can be added also for a very small cost. The location is really great for shopping and restaurants nearby. I definitely would recommend for a few quick nights or for the budget conscience. The rooms have everything you need and are comfortable.  Special mention to Septi & Grace for their wonderful service. Thanks again.,"We stayed 4 days in Bali and booked room at both Amnaya Kuta and Benoa. Had a great time here for our trip.  I love the yoga room upper the gym and my friend loves the swimming pool and bar area.  We tried Balinese and Bamboo massage at their spa in the mean time waiting for check-in at 3pm. Sarini, Sefti and Rasmi were taking such a good care for us.  The resort just opened in November so everything is brand new and good quality.   I definitely will stay here again if I have a chance to visit Bali again.","Very nice area, swimming pool, cozy rooms with all necessary equipment. The hotel has two very good restaurants. There are beautiful beaches and restaurants near the hotel which you can reach in a few minutes by renting a scooter. Very kind and helpful staff. Everything was perfect!"
"Its such a good choice to come here. We come here after visiting Kintamani for lunch.

They put most hotel staff in Europe to shame. The cool, pastel colours of the interior are a welcome escape from the harsh sun outside and the sound proofing throughout the open - courtyard interior is so good that you don't realise that you are on a main road. The rooms are lovely with towels and bedding in glow white. You can arrive in the clothes you stand in since everything is provided for a great stay down to toothbrush pack. The room price is a steal at around 15 dollars double, with a great, unlimited breakfast at 4 dollars.

We will go straight here!  Location: The hotel is situated on a busy street but somehow you cannot hear the traffic noise in the hotel at all! There are plenty of restaurants and bars that line the street.  Room: we were upgraded to the Junior suite and boy, it was outstanding. Can't fault a thing. Ensuite bathtub, big sit out deck with sun beds, great in room amenities - just perfect.   Resturant: A lot of reviews rave about the breakfast and they are all right.

From the simple (but amazing) Indian Head Massage to The Romance Package (2,5 hrs!) everything is great. Everyday I tried something new, and it was worth it.

Getting ripped off by the taxi driver from the airport didn't help my mood. But all my anxieties melted away on arrival at the Amnaya Resort Benoa. To summarise: the welcome was warmer than the Bali sunshine; the facilities were amazing; the room itself was lovely (cleaned every day); the not-overly-chlorinated-swimming pool was excellent and not too crowded during my two week stay; and the free, fresh air yoga (Fridays) was a real treat.

Great staff all members really helpful, rooms really clean, with Bali beautiful design and spacious. There are 2 delicious restaurants available so for more than 2 days not much variety of food.

The are 2 beaches near: impossible beach that is walking distance aprox 15 mins, however it has many stairs and the path isn’t nice. The other is Padang Padang and the hotel offers a Shuttle, however is full of people and surfers.

It is clear that the hotel is currently offering discounted rooms in order to attract good reviews prior to their full opening next year.  We found the staff to be really friendly and helpful with our enquires. The pool is lovely with solid beds situated partly in the pool or full sized beds to lounge on. The only downside is the pool area is quite small if the hotel is at full capacity.  We found the food served was delicious- the breakfast offers a huge selection to choose from. It was almost too much to stomach!  ,"I can’t really fault this hotel. Everything was as it should be at a Radisson.  Staff were excellent throughout, the SpaEsc is marvellous and worth every dollar. Breakfast is an efficient affair catering for most tastes. Great fresh, healthy choices and the egg station is a well oiled machine.  Artichoke and Filini also very good. The Lookout bar makes fabulous cocktails (seriously, the best Mojitos in all of Uluwatu!), and its a nice place just to sit and read and write whilst enjoying the views.  The large pool never seems particularly crowded, and poolside service is smart.   My single only gripe is that the delicious empanadas that were on the menu previously have disappeared! They were superb. A top floor balcony suite is well worth it, with private decking on 2 sides. Lots…"

The only thing that I was a bit dissapointed with was the lack of food choices at the pool. The pizza we got only had sparse toppings making it only a cheese pizza really, and the hummus was only 2 pieces of pita with a smidge of hummus.

We had dinner there....a smallish menu of Balinese plus western foods....presentation 10/10, platter of tapas offered for free before our meal....they were delicious, and drinks/cocktails excellent. Karayawan (Komang) gave us a quick tour of the spa area, very impressive indeed, and we were looked after by Piki at our table.  Excellent service. Maybe could add a small lamp or torch for each table so the menu is easy to read. We had a very pleasant experience..we will return again .....thankyou Staff !","This is by far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. From the first day until when we left the staff made us feel like we belonged (Widya and Harry from pool and restaurant service were excellent and the highlight of our trip!). Just the minor touches and service to the rooms make you feel like your in another world. Heaps of couples and families and no overlapping, amenities and restaurants will make you not want to leave the hotel. Highly recommend especially for surfers wanting some luxury!!!!"

Will come back again ! ","Stayed at this beautiful resort with another couple on a Luxury Escapes package in November.  The package was very generous, included breakfast each day and two meals for the duration of our stay as well as a massage each.  The resort is quiet and beautifully appointed.  The pool area is expansive and not difficult to get a cabana or lounge.  Our rooms were spacious, clean and modern.  My personal view is the restaurants on site were a little lacking to come up to 5 star level.  The breakfast offerings are vast but could do with some extra attention to detail.  The staff were all friendly at the Radisson Blu and the spa area is lovely.  A 15 minute walk will take you into Uluwatu if you don't want to wait for the shuttle bus."

Our room was on the 5th floor facing the ocean and the pool and it came with a balcony where we enjoyed drinking coffee at sunrise. The hotel has a fully-equipped gym that is well maintained. The pool area is huge and there are various lounge chairs and cabanas, as well as a bar,  surrounding the pool. The pool is well lit at night giving the property a romantic feel at night time. However, the pool closes rather early. The pool also seems very shallow, so not really great for guests that like hanging out in the pool as it barely comes up to one's thighs.   The hotel has two restaurants on the property, which I think are the highlight and benefit of staying at this hotel. Unfortunately for me, check-in staff…"

The location was great (central and not far from the beach), the room was perfect with shower pressure to die for & the breakfast buffet was PHENOMENAL.  The staff were what made it for me! Particularly being a solo traveller, it was so lovely to be welcomed with a smile. Shout out to Yoshi, Lermana, Sanjaya & Darmawan who went above and beyond to make Grandmas feel like home, the nicest guys ever with such kind hearts. Appreciate you <U+2764><U+FE0F>","From  all the hotels in Bali that was the newest. ( I stayed january 2020). It is on budged. The breakfast was a la carte, good choices. coffee was good too which in Bali for European people is difficult to find  nice coffee. I used thw app Grab for food delivery as i wanted to eat at my hotel pizza etc. (Indonesian food wasnt my taste).",We ended our trip here for 2 nights after spending 8 nights in other parts of Bali (Nusa Lembongan and Keremas).  The hotel is relatively new and the rooms very well designed. The staff are wonderful and very well trained. The free sunrise yoga is great. Free shuttles run to Padang-Padang and Uluwatu.  The breakfast buffet was really good. The food at the pool was good too - great woodfired pizza and salads. Plenty of sun beds surrounding the huge pool.  The location is fairly remote and you need to use Taxis to go anywhere or hire a scooter. There are some surf shops and a restaurant/bar about 10 minute walk up the driveway. Impossibles surf beach is a 10minute walk away down a very steep path and from there you can walk over the rocks to Bingin at low tide.  The spa was lovely…
"The Temple so nice there have so many kind different Temple,and from besakih temple you can see mount agung so wonderful view!",Great place to take pictures.

Without  a guide?? Wanting to go but not into the usual tourist group thing. I'm in ubud at present.,This was our experience at Aling Aling Falls and the people we have met.

A bit noisy in the evening, but after one day got used to that","Only just opened when we stayed - working hard to impress. Staff wonderful, rooms luxurious and food off the scale - best breakfast I’ve ever eaten with not a grid egg in sight! Utter bliss in the spa suite - choice of massage treatments with choice of oils and choice of teas. Probably best hotel in my experience and unbelievably cheap - though I think this will change.

My husband and I always visit Bali 2-3x a year; whether it is for a short getaway, wedding, or golf event. We have stayed in so many hotels and we can say that Radisson Blu is in the top 3 of our most favorite hotels in Bali. First of all, we love the location. The hotel is situated on top of a hill, overlooking the ocean. It is not as crowded as Seminyak and Nusa Dua but there are still a lot of things to do in the area. Lots of good restaurants on the main street and beautiful beaches within 10-15 minutes driving. The hotel itself is fairly new and well-maintained. We love the modern and open-air lobby and we can’t get enough of the pool. There are plenty of lounge chairs and cabanas and lots of trees to give some…"

The new system is they charge a bit more but includes sarong and tour guide, local one, so your tour guide can’t come in with you,   Impressive.","As long as they are fed,  and you follow rules...the forest is worth it alone.  Cool and graceful.  Overgrown roots,  mossy strobe,  chuckling river.  ",Kuta beach by Beach Mall. Very busy beach . Advise to go off season if you can. Beach mall is a great place for food,"Yes it is a spectacular view if you can get to see it with all the aggressive sellers/hawkers up there.

The drive around the volcano and lake was well worth…",Had an amazing time with my guide jumping from cliffs ranging from 5 meters to 15 meters and ofcourse the Aling Aling waterslide of 12meters.  The surroundings are pure nature and the adrenaline rush you get from jumping is great!   A must do if you're in Bali,"Very nice stay in this place, rooms are cosy and neat. The staff is very helpful and make you feel special (welcome drink). Rooms have air con, television, mini fridge, safe and everything we need. They offer breakfast for 60 000, their salty options are way better than the sweets one. They also try to control their impact on environment and it is much appreciated! ","This was the best hotel we stayed at in Bali, based on quality that exceeded the price, warm homelike atmosphere and facilities to satisfy any healing needs.  Everything is so well thought: every table at the cozy reading corner, the peaceful restaurant where you can enjoy the breeze & study in the afternoon, the beautiful yoga nest where you can stretch & unwind at sunset, BEAUTIFUL tanning place at the pool and perfectly blended colours & Balinese architecture that caress your eye, and the true, genuine hospitality! Oh and comfortable bedding. The intuitive service where you get the lights on right when you can't read anymore because of the dawn, without asking anyone.

Rooms are small and there is an open closet above the desk. However, the place is clean, beds are comfy with firm and soft pillows, breakfast is great. All staff called me by name.

The reception staff are super friendly and helpful and every day ask if everything is ok. Meika arranged my tours and a driver, Ana showed me how to repare the canang Sari and pray.

Checkin was a bit problem, but the service after that was excellent. Most of the staff are very polite and always try to make the best. Breakfast was included our roomrate, its really big and fresh.  Will come back again ! ","The Radisson Blu Uluwatu is a true gem. It is a rather new hotel on the Uluwatu peninsula, which is a beautiful and not so crowded part of Bali (relative to the Seminyak or Ubud areas). The hotel is close to a laid back surfer village with nice stores, restaurants and bars. The hotel offers a free shuttle to different beaches close by as well as to the Uluwatu Temple (schedule available at reception).   Upon arrival we were assigned to room 615, the room itself was beautiful (as all rooms in the hotel), but lacked a view. We asked reception whether they could relocate us to a room with a nicer view, which they kindly agreed to: we were assigned room 727 (in a different building and higher up, which has a fantastic view).  The rooms itself are very spacious, have very comfortable…"

Well looked after and fed by the locals every morning. Keep everything in a bag zipped up and close to you, because the cute monkeys will take it.

The hotel is beautfully designed, the rooms are immaculately clean, the staff are extremely courteous and helpful, the included breakfast is the best that I have ever had at a hotel, and the value for money is incredible. On top of that they upgraded our room for free. This truly is the best place I think I have ever stayed at.  It is usually not too difficult to find flaws in hotel in Bali. My partner has a keen eye for dirt and an even keener nose for damp and other smells, and this is the first place we've ever stayed that is truly flawless. I take my hat off to the staff and management here for keeping the place so beautiful and clean.  I am never motivated to write review for hotels, but Amnaya Benoa is just so good that I felt compelled to. I look forward to visiting here again!…","The most beautiful place in the world.

","The situation of the brand new hotel on the cliff in Uluwatu between Bingin and Padang Padang beaches, far from the crowd, is excellent. A direct view on the ocean, however, is made impossible by trees and walls surrounding the premises. This is frustrating and mitigates the interest for a superior room said to offer ocean view.  Only a micro-boutique is available at the spa, which is practically useless. As the hotel is quite remote from the civilisation, availability of a small store and an automatic teller machine would be a big plus. The room and balcony were very nice as well as the services and restaurants. The big asset of the hotel is its fantastic swimming pool and the very large, well maintained area surrounding it."

This place is a joke. You will be extorted for money the second you walk in.

Got good bike parking. Good place for jogging. Nice place to learn surfing. There are people will teach surfing but need to pay for it.

Far enough off the main road to be quiet but also close enough to walk or just a 2 min scooter ride to some great cafe's and shops. The massage in the spa treatment are was wonderful and very luxurious. A great pool with lovely surrounds. Both restaurants in the hotel were sensational. The only thing we were slightly disappointed in was the buffet breakfast. It was still very good but it just wasn't quite as good as we were expecting given how incredible everything else was in the hotel. Overall: Highly recommend
We read all the reviews and thought maybe best to stay away.

My wife and I came to celebrate a anniversary and were very happy with the hotel and team running it. We had an amazing low tide walk from the easy accessible stairs leading to Impossibles beach all the way to Dreamland (New Kuta Beach) this was one of the highlights of our holiday...Don't try it on High Tide! As a keen surfer I found it to be excellent as Impossibles is close using the stairs down the cliff and also Bingin is only about another 10 minutes south. If you want to surf Ulu's and Padang Padang hire a bike with a rack as its only 5 to 10 minutes away. The food was of a very high standard and good value for money.

Everything is immaculate, very Serene and beautifully designed. Everybody who works here is extremely friendly, attentive and welcoming.

Then when driving off in taxi chase taxi down- towel had a few small marks from tattoo (would easily wash out)- didn’t have time to wait for supervisor so paid $10 to go and cover cost. Honestly a bit over the top if you ask me. Would not recommend.,"This was the best hotel we stayed at in Bali, based on quality that exceeded the price, warm homelike atmosphere and facilities to satisfy any healing needs.

Highlights:  -…",Great half day out. 3 cliffs to jump off along with a 10m waterfall to slide down.

My husband and I visited the temple last month and their tour guide was very informative when it came to telling us about the history of the temple. It is definitively worth the visit if you want to take in some history and culture.,The site is not well maintained and the monkeys are not particularly well behaved. I would suggest simply encountering monkeys in the street in Ubud near the forest. ,We went to Kuta beach during sunset. I was totally amazed with the sights I saw even though it was a little cloudy. I think this place is a must go during sunset. Attaching some pictures of the same. ,This is a fairly easy climb but there are SO many people doing it there can be traffic (people) jams going up and down.

About a one kilometre from the main club precinct of skygarden etc but there are countless bars and restaurants (better I reckon) in between. Also about 800 metres to Kuta beach. Rooms are small but very clean and great service and it only cost us about $29 Aud for a room. Only downside is no pool. ,"I have lived in Bali for a while and visited various hotels and resorts, and Amnaya is far beyond any place that I have stayed here, or even anywhere else.  The hotel is beautfully designed, the rooms are immaculately clean, the staff are extremely courteous and helpful, the included breakfast is the best that I have ever had at a hotel, and the value for money is incredible. On top of that they upgraded our room for free. This truly is the best place I think I have ever stayed at.  It is usually not too difficult to find flaws in hotel in Bali. My partner has a keen eye for dirt and an even keener nose for damp and other smells, and this is the first place we've ever stayed that is truly flawless. I take my hat off to the staff and management here for keeping the place so beautiful and clean.  I am never motivated to write review for hotels, but Amnaya Benoa is just so good that I felt compelled to. I look forward to visiting here again!…",Had the most wonderful relaxing holiday at The Raddison Uluwatu. The hotel is beautifully designed from large comfortable bedrooms to huge swimming pool and an abundance of beds and cabanas to choose  from.Breakfast was fresh and delicious with a large selection to suit all tastes.

There are some nice bars along the beach too.,Great views and good food.love it!If u ride down from the village u can visit the hotsprings aswell.,"Awesome slide in natural waterfalls. The first waterfall is the most beautiful but the others are more fun. The local guide spoke good English and was very helpful. We paid 250k for 2 people, but we should've bargained. I am not sure if this place is safe so be careful.","Good hotel, good price and good location. This is my second time stay at this hotel. Overall, i am satisfied staying in this hotel. The breakfast is very limited selections and very limited parking space","From  all the hotels in Bali that was the newest. ( I stayed january 2020). It is on budged.

The room was narrow but adequate. Kettle, tea coffee, fridge. Bathroom was clean and all worked. Breakfast in the morning was a little confusing but I put that down to language.

I would highly recommend this however to a couple or a family with older kids.  As amazing as it was, I don’t think it’s ideal for a family with small children because the hotel is extremely quiet.  The kids play room is nothing special and there’s nothing for kids to do besides swim in the pool.  I would stay there again if it was just my husband and I. "

Booked a room via booking.com for my honeymoon and a night before I was flying to Bali, I found out that my room was cancelled without even explaining the reason or sending an email about this. I entered my booking.com to check the address of the hotel and realized that the room was cancelled. When I called the hotel, the guy from the staff told me that they didn’t exchange the information about available rooms with booking.com properly and it was outdated, that’s why my reservation got cancelled.  I was totally shocked since nobody even sent me an email about this.   This is a shame for such a famous chain! Very disappointed. They just damaged my honeymoon.  Do not recommend to anyone. "

Rooms clean, modern, good sized and well equipped but unfortunately with paper thin walls so earplugs could be very handy.

The hotel isn’t very near any shops or restaurants so unless you’re prepared to get taxis everywhere you’re stuck with what’s on offer at the hotel.  The food isn’t fantastic and there’s room for improvement but the staff more than make up for it.  There’s only a few items there’s a surcharge for with the Luxury Escapes vouchers.

Shower was very good also. The staff were extremely efficient and welcoming.   Only thing I’d say is that it wasn’t made clear that this hotel is in Kuta and not Seminyak. However it turned out we preferred the beach in Kuta anyway. ","From  all the hotels in Bali that was the newest. ( I stayed january 2020). It is on budged. The breakfast was a la carte, good choices. coffee was good too which in Bali for European people is difficult to find  nice coffee.

This was well worth the extra money for the bigger room with balconies. The resort was excellent & ranked up with the best - we have been to many Bali resorts and would definitely return to this one. Like most Bali resorts, the staff were the standout experience.  The restaurants both provided excellent food at a reasonable price and the staff always provided excellent service. Special thanks to Diego the Food & Beverages Manager and his staff, especially Widi, Arya, Adit & Olla. We used the spa twice but found it to be expensive (but provided a good service). We would highly recommend this package."

I was a bit nervous about them jumping all over me but think if you follow the rules you will be fine. Did see a few dive on people but from what I saw it was the tourists own fault.

The only improvement I could suggest is maybe the speed of the poolside service. At times our frozen concoctions were not so frozen by the time they made it to us. The other thing is the Artichoke restaurant for evening dining. The food was average. The Italian restaurant was much better. 
"We visited this temple as it was one of the ""must see"" temples. It is very pretty, but there is so much rubbish, plastic, etc. lying around it is disgusting!! They really need to clean this place up. Also, if this is more than 30min drive - it's not worth it at all!! ","Great to see free ranging monkeys. Very safe, just give them space and don’t stick camera in their faces. Don’t tease them with food.  Clean, well-kept park with waterfalls and pools that the monkeys jump into. Don’t miss it ","So Kuta beach is long and looks great but it’s actually really filthy. There is rubbish everywhere. Although lots of people were surfing and swimming I decided not to risk it. You can’t sit and relax because your constantly being approached by sellers, they can be quite…",Mount Batur is so beautiful even when it's raining it's still stunning. This time we ventured down the bottom and you can see where the lava has been when the volcano erupted. The soil at the bottom is so rich the age grows so many crops in ransom spots ,,"For the money you pay what you get here is absolutely phenomenal. Free breakfast buffet every day including a main meal chosen from a menu, excellent service and very helpful English-speaking staff. Rooms are very clean and come with all the amenities you need including two free bottles of water every day which is great since you can't drink water in Bali.   I really enjoyed everything until the last day, which really soured our experience unfortunately. Me and my Indonesian girlfriend returned to the hotel at night as we had for the last 6 days before, and the doorman profiled her and assumed that she was a prostitute I was bringing back, just because I'm a foreigner and she's Indonesian, asking her for ID without asking me for any. Previously we had never been asked for ID…","I have lived in Bali for a while and visited various hotels and resorts, and Amnaya is far beyond any place that I have stayed here, or even anywhere else.  The hotel is beautfully designed, the rooms are immaculately clean, the staff are extremely courteous and helpful, the included breakfast is the best that I have ever had at a hotel, and the value for money is incredible. On top of that they upgraded our room for free. This truly is the best place I think I have ever stayed at.  It is usually not too difficult to find flaws in hotel in Bali. My partner has a keen eye for dirt and an even keener nose for damp and other smells, and this is the first place we've ever stayed that is truly flawless. I take my hat off to the staff and management here for keeping the place so beautiful and clean.  I am never motivated to write review for hotels, but Amnaya Benoa is just so good that I felt compelled to. I look forward to visiting here again!…","This property is severely under priced. Total value for money and an amazing experience. The rooms, staff, breakfast, check in, check out, beds, views and service are 5 star all the way.

The sunset there is amazing most days and there are a lot of places to learn surfing. Very good for beginners. Sadly, there is no shady spot to lay in at the beach, because there are surf schools, food shops etc. under the palm trees. ",Kintamani is a village on the western edge of the caldera and a great place to see Kintamani Volcano and Mount Batur (one of four volcanoes in Bali).,,"We arrived at this hotel at 2 AM after a long day at the airport and were very pleased with the welcome we received by the friendly reception even though it was an ungodly hour to check in. Their rooms were absolutely clean, the bathroom nice, and the overall decor of the hotel was very youthful and lively. My favorite thing about the hotel would have to be the location - located at the corner of one of Legian's busiest intersections was really helpful for us, especially in finding options for dining. One thing the hotel could improve on was probably the external lighting for me because it was a bit difficult to find the signage for the hotel at first, but overall, it's definitely a good hotel for short stays.","From  all the hotels in Bali that was the newest. ( I stayed january 2020). It is on budged. The breakfast was a la carte, good choices. coffee was good too which in Bali for European people is difficult to find  nice coffee. I used thw app Grab for food delivery as i wanted to eat at my hotel pizza etc. (Indonesian food wasnt my taste).",Me and my family spent two nights here on a family trip. Rooms are spacious amd luxurious appointed (Sensatia Botanicals toiletries is always a plus). Bed was comfortable but I have to ask the engineer to put the AC not in the Auto Mode because the Hotel SOP. Maybe the receptionist should have told the guest first at the check-in proscess. The breakfast and the afternoon tea waa excellent! Love the foods! But less Indonesian foods. They also have their own private beach with 120 stairs if I’m not mistaken. It was pretty and quiet. Overall it was excellent.

In return the monkeys are not afraid and allow you to see them up close - even the tiny babies,Cool place but a bit annoying because everyone is trying to sell you something - ideal for learning to surf ,If your goal is to see the sunrise and views at the top then pray for clear skies.

Christmas Day 2019 resulted in a great trek up and down but the sunrise photos are…,,"Comfortable and clean room. Bath room is nice and clean. Room size is okay, not too large but also not cramped. Located near the center of touristy area in Bali. Price is on medium range. In my opinion, a good offer.","Only just opened when we stayed - working hard to impress. Staff wonderful, rooms luxurious and food off the scale - best breakfast I’ve ever eaten with not a grid egg in sight!

I arrived in the morning thinking i have hours before my check in, but got lucky they check me in early. Superb services from conceirge, room services and people in the restaurants, though I forgot all your names I always remembered your faces. Room was just so nice and cozy, veranda overlooking the pool, glimpse of the ocean and the mountain made so happy for my 4 nights stay. Room service is just so speechless they clean my room twice in a day with a chocolate to top of it or some cookies. Loved the amenities in the room like the speaker in the bathroom, cutie bag that i can carry around. Small touches can make me smile during my stay. The spa is so relaxing and the people I meet there…"

We were there for a romantic break and to re-connect our marriage, as well as to celebrate my 50th birthday. The trip was a total success in every way. We have been to Bali at least 10 times previously, and this was the best trip yet. Some would say the location is isolated, I would call it picturesque and serene. Easy walk to convenience shops, money changer, ATM, excellent local cafes. Otherwise wait 5 minutes while the friendly reception staff call a metered taxi to take you further afield. Traffic can be busy and can take around an hour to the busy Seminyak area. Totally satisfied with the resort, the staff, the comforts, the breakfast, the pool.

Dinner at the Italian restaurant later was just as bad, Carbonara was not made authentically (it had cream instead of egg), pasta was hard. The risotto was also hard. The bar also has not atmosphere.  Nice rooms and breakfast was good, but this hotel really needs to improve its catering to hit the standard it is going for, especially considering there are limited other food options close by."
A magnificent architectural gem. The temple is one of the oldest Hindu temple in Bali.  The hillside location makes it attractive and offers great panoramic views across. Traditional and cultural norms needs to be adhered to as with all Hindu temples in Bali.,An extremely beautiful place. Extremely clean and constantly getting swept and cleaned while being there.

I was surprised to find out that we were not allowed to smoke in the open space balconies in the room, we can only smoke in the designated smoking area which was down near the pool or in the parking lot.

The rooms are appalling, the service inexplicably poor, the facilities in the rooms are old tired, and dirty.

We had a relaxing escape holiday which allowed us to stay around the pool each day or explore nearby beaches or go further afield by using a driver for the day. This is a newish resort and the attention to maintenance and dealing with any minor request was prompt. The morning breakfasts were unbeatable as they catered for Western as well as Asian tastes. The Happy Hour around the pool and the Valentine Day dinner were very memorable. This is a resort for getting away from the hustle and bustle of other parts of Bali. It is highly recommended. We will return in the future.

Whilst there are many Pro's to the resort & its surrounds, ultimately these were outweighed by the many material Con's.

CONS:  - The hotel design is genuine safety hazard - the corridors are exposed to weather elements and become flooded whenever it rains.

I was  really exhausted at that time but soonest as I opened the door of my room, that feeling was gone. I had a lovely room with a quote on its wall ""Love will find the way"". The room was quite small but very clean, cozy and comfortable. There was a wooden plank shelf tied with sail rope on the wall. There were cloth hanger hung on it as a solution to keep your cloth neat and smooth as they don't have cupboard.

Good transfer service to and from airport but not cheap.  Good and drinks are reasonably priced especially at happy hour. Spa is very nice but not cheap.  Rooms are nice but aircon inconsistent.  Location is secluded and only advantage is near to Uluwatu temple and not much else.  Shuttle bus is only free to uluwatu temple and Padang beach - they don’t even drop you at main road shops (850 metres along narrow road) and they don’t allow Grab or GOJEK rides. That’s my only complaint. I know management must have their reasons for this but it’ll only cause unhappiness for guests.

Price comparison is excellent and would recommend Grandmas to you. Rooms are smallish - but adequate and recently refurbished well.  BEWARE EXCHANGING MONEY. There are numerous money changers (small in back of shops and lanes etc) in the area. We very quickly became aware (at our expense) that there is a trick played by each money changer every single time. They count out the money on their side of the counter and allow you to check it.

The two restaurants and pool bar offer decent, reasonably priced food, however often the service was a bit haphazard.

It is enough for me, but the taste is so so.   Room : the cleanliness is bad, when i left the room at the afternoon and came back at night, there are ants sorrounds my mineral water. I supposed they didnt clean the room. Bathroom amenities is fine, but the shower is poor. AC is chilled, the bed is good.   Staff services : just good.

Since this is a new hotel (6 months) while we stayed here, the rooms are very clean as well as the rest of the resort.  There are enough chairs and bungalows around the poolside, no need to rush down to save a spot.  The food in all the restaurants is very good and reasonably priced for a 5-star resort.

We also used their spa service.   The food was great esp tge pizza . However the reason I'm giving it 4 star is because when you have a luxury escape voucher they produce a much smaller menu. So when you spend time looking at the menu outside and then go in to the resturant we were disappointed.  We have used luxury escape deals many times and have never experienced a small menu.  So, if you do have a luxury escape deal dont look at the menu outside the resturant.   Also the resort is quite isolated for things to do however to eat  ..dont worry that there is only 2 resturants on site because The cafes down the street were amazing for beautiful fresh organic food.…"

The restaurants were good too, we particularly liked the  Italian restaurant Filini. Breakfast was great, with the choice of indoor or outdoor seating overlooking the pool. There were many Western and Indonesian options. We had several treatments at the spa and we were impressed with the care and attention of the therapists.

The only thing missing was a good adjoining beach. We’re in the “elderly class”, and the steep stair access to the main beach was not easy for us. Neverless we thoroughly enjoyed the week and will almost certainly return because of the great friendliness of the staff."

The rooms are big and have everything you need. Good breakfast and nice options for lunch & dinner. It’s not as big as other resorts in for example the Nusa Dua area but it makes the hotel have more charm and character. The personnel is also very good and helpful.    The location is good since it’s very easy to access restaurants and beaches in the whole Uluwatu area so if you prefer a hotel rather then renting a villa it’s very well situated!

The hotel has a great pool and very spacious rooms with balcony. Breakfast is rich, served both in and outdoors.

(That is for an approx. 20 minute trip)  Good place to stay and a big thank you to Luvi Dinata, one of the lovely staff.",,"Agree with many of the reviews - great food, lovely staff etc - but no one has mentioned the elephant in the room - although you could easily fit 5 of 6 elephants in the room they are so big!  No I mean the fact that you actually have to stand in the shower cubicle to turn it on and there is no way to avoid the deluge of cold water drilling a hole in your head before it warms up!  But don't let that put you off.

We had to call to ask for them for replacement water, shower gel and toilet paper. The T.V also cut out one of the nights we stayed and did not come back on till morning.

The pool was very quiet, making it quite awkward to talk. A bit of music would have made a huge difference.   The hotel was newly opened and this was quite evident. The juice bar was not open and the occupancy seemed low.  "
"I visited here while i following my local host where i stayed in the ritual of ngaben. to reach this temple for praying, you need to visit one temple below that i forgot the name. the amazing thing is that this temple fits perfectly with the mount agung as its background. im…","Nice place to enjoy with the monkeys. A lot of monkeys. Very nice park with lot of big trees, better visit early in the morning, quiet and not too warm.","If you visit Bali alone, like i did, Kuta beach its your place :) Friendly locals offering surfing lessons, beer, chairs and funny conversations :) great place for hang out!","I must admit that I had been too lazy to check much about the trip beforehand. I had just heard it is an easy trek. For me, definitely not so. See further down. It takes 1.5 hours to get to the first point, and another 25 minutes to get to the peak. The sunrise is beautiful from…",,"We stayed here as it was central to what we normally do when in Bali. It was close to money changers, laundry agents, Gloria jeans coffee house was another regular place visited by us. We are older people and found it very central and easy walking to whatever we wanted to do. The staff were extremely helpful especially when needed after a fall was had and staff from the hotel came down the street to help us back to the hotel.",,"We always love the Radisson Blu and the same was the case for Uluwatu.  As the hotel is brand new everything is pristine, fresh and stunning. Loved the open air layout.  Pros: The super buffet breakfast was amazing and so much selection, rooms were great value and immaculate, big pool and plenty of loungers  Cons: It was weirdly quiet and it seemed like it wasn’t fully functioning yet e.g the juice bar by the pool we were keen to try was not open, the spa was not staffed when I went in and there is very little ambience around the place - almost needs a bit of music. We found ourselves almost whispering by the pool as felt awkward talking.  Service is SLOW and rare by the pool. Unlike other hotels we stayed at the waiters didn’t come around much to take drink/food orders - we…"
"After I read all the reviews, I must say I was expecting worst   However , whoever didn't get a sarong , make sure you buy it for 50,000 not more as they start with 300,000  We paid tourism fees at the beginning , then we go to big the sarong and then we make a donation to the…","We really enjoyed this place. Plenty to see aside from the funny little creatures. Temples, amazing trees and even burial grounds. In fact a grave was being dug while we were there, which was oddly interesting to see and read about.","Nice beach, pretty clean, good surf, lots of cheap surf hire places, though quite alot of sellers with their bangles and trinkets that pester you on the beach and sometimes stick around ages even when you have said no thankyou 5 times already!! ","What an easy and challenging trek in one go.... amazing experience with the group that was randomly put together as I was alone from my hotel. We had a couple who carried an year old baby and a five year old boy. They were so inspiring to see. While our guide was super friendly,…",,"Room and toilet are clean, beautiful and comfy. Great hospitality and service. Breakfast is delicious, especially the fried rice.. Yum! Strategic location, a lot of reataurants and spa near hotel. Also near Kuta Beach. Will definitely stay here again next time I come to Bali. :)",,"New hotel so very peaceful and quiet. Beautiful designed and well laid out, lots of space. We stayed in an ocean view deluxe room but even one without a view would be great as you can walk around the hotel easily to see the view, especially from the bar in the lobby. We had the 5 night Luxury escapes package which was perfect. Not a lot to do around the area unless you’re into surfing but you can walk 15 minutes up the road to different cafes and warungs. Staff so helpful and welcoming. TV dropped in and out but that wasn’t a big deal. Beautiful sitting outside at night around the pool enjoying a cocktail and a meal."
"The reviews are right, local people hassling you and conning you. So many other beautiful temples in Bali.   Try going to Bratan, Taman ayun, Klungkung or Khehen for a quieter experience without the hassle. Sorry about spelling.","I’ve never thought of myself as a person scared of monkeys, but this place really tests your limits. The animals are absolutely adorable and ya wanna just snuggle them, but then they get close to you and you no longer wish for snuggles. Do NOT bring bags when you visit as the…",Good beach with cleaniness. There was shopping and art centre around. So many restaurants too were there around. ,"Thank you Mount Batur Sunrise Trekking for a memorable and wonderful adventures!  I contacted Gede, the owner, via email and WhatsApp and he was prompt with answering my questions and providing details of what was included and not included with price of the tour.   I was…",,The location of the hotel is ideal to go anywhere. Stay in this region as it is cheaper than on Kuta beach and its just 10 mins walk to beach. You are able to get food around this area and walk to sky garden where all the Pubs and Clubs will be for about 15 to 20 mins?,,"Stayed here for the first time, We had a room with oceans views would defiantly come back again. The staff were very good, I left a camera in the room on check out and the staff contacted me and returned it to me. "
Glad that we read before and were prepared for the rip off attempts. The temple offers lovely views but the experience is all ruined by shabby locals who sell their own Gods and religion to earn some bucks. Only instance where we hated Bali.,"We enjoyed watching the monkeys as they can be quite ornery or loving depending ;D What was most interesting to me was the beauty of the trees, temples and statues, especially the temple down below by the river. The roots of the trees hanging down creating curtains across the…","Kuta beach is average as far as beaches go, there is allot of brocken coral which is a bit hard on the feet, there is no shade unless you buy a drink from the locals which you can then drink under their umbrella and sit on their chairs, you have to pay to use the bathroom, been…","I brought my 7 yo daughter to experience her first mountain hike and was really glad with the decision. The hike is excellent for my daughter with a perfect combo of easy trek and challenging climb.  I had an excellent guide recommended by our hotel (volcano terrace bali).

Staffs are nice and helpful... Even though the room is small, overall it's the nice place to stay.....  ",,"Great new hotel, lovely staff, and good breakfast. Would have loved to be a bit closer to the beach. Uluwatu is however a bit quiet. It’s hard to get meter taxis here, since most of the trips are fixed rates. "
"Very grand temple, it is one of the important temple of Bali as well. Mount Agung forms the backdrop of this temple, good for phototaking at any angle. Sarongs and a guide are needed as well, both are charged with a fee. The guide will use his best of knowledge to communicate in…","You know what you’re going to get just based on the name but it’s still a treat. It’s amazing that right in the middle of the city there are a thousand monkeys in a natural habitat just being monkeys.  If you put yourself in the right place, they will get on your head, pick your…","Kuta is a hot spot for a reason, whilst it is very busy - it literally has everything. Great food & drink. Cuisines from all over the globe. The beach at your doorstep and surfboards available for hire at your fingertips. My favourite is the sunset, it doesn’t get old! Here is a…",we booked a ticket along monkey forest street in Ubud. There were 19 people in the group and sadly 5 people were very very slow and almost give up in the middle way!! This meant our guides had to help them and for several times we had to wait long minutes until we felt very cold…,,"The location of the hotel is good, it's strategically located on Legian road, where you can walk to Kuta within 15-20 mins along the shopping streets, couldn't really find any good restaurants nearby though but if you walk to Kuta there's plenty over there.  The room is small, as expected because of the location and price, breakfast is ala carte based on the menu given but drinks are bottomless.  If you need extra pillow or towel you'll have to pay extra, IDR100,000 for one if I'm not mistaken. The hotel is situated on Legian road so expect some noise at night but thanks to the FREE EARBUD!",,An experience that I can remember for a long time. Friendly service and beautiful relaxing atmosphere with the view of the amazing Indian Ocean. Good foods big room and a standard that for sure to improve. 
"Visiting the ""Mother-Temple"" is for sure worth it, but be aware it can easily end up in a rip off. We paid 10000 IRP as an entrance fee to be allowed to drive up to the parking lot, there we had to rent Saroongs for another 15000 per person. After that we've been guided to…",What a lovely and cool place to be. The monkeys run freely in the area “semi-free ranged” as they are so called and it’s just a nice day to sit and watch them play and frolic.  Remember to keep all items to yourself or in your bag though. They are quick! But it was nice quiet…,"You would not need any extra cost for enjoying Kuta beach, if you are living in Kuta and areas around. Wide enough for sports and activities, secured and safe enough for family activities.  Together with my two sons and wife we spent two of our Bali evenings on Kuta beach.

All through out they were friendly, accommodating  and caring giving surprises like getting us free wifi and water bottles in their…",,This is a great little budget hotel in a good location. Its close to restaurants and shops plus a few minutes walk to the beach.  The room we had was quite small but as  we were only here for 1 night due to moving on to Ubud is was great. The hotel is quite new so everything is new and very clean. Breakfast was included and we had a choice of set meals to choose from. This was really good as well. I'd recommend this hotel no problem for a few days stay but theres no pool so if you want to lounge around then maybe try elsewhere.  ,,"If you are looking for a calm and beautiful place in Bali, I recommend you Radisson Blue Uluwatu. Every morning when you wake up, you can hear the waves of the sea and smell the nature because this hotel is located on the cliff of the seaside and has beautiful plants everywhere in its area. The stuff is very friendly. Their smile and will give you a smile too :)"
"This large temple complex is very impressive and beautiful.  There are three main temples (honoring Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu) as well as many smaller temples and family temples.  This is the 'mother temple' for the Balinese and central to worship.  A large funeral/purification…",This monkey park was a bit of a let-down as it was basically just a small compound with nothing much to see other than monkeys. The few temples that were in the compound were not open to public and there were no information signboard to read and understand more about the…,"This was our first visit to Kuta Beach. It was beautiful, clean and had a good vibe. The water was warm and clear. We enjoyed drinks at some of the local bars and I tried my first fresh coconut water. It was delicious. The only downfall I would say was that the people looking…","We left our villa (in Kuta) around 1am and started the hike at around 4am and managed to reach the summit by 6am just in time to see the sunrise. It can be a relatively challenging hike if you have not exercising regularly. The view is amazing and it is very cold up there, do…",,"You get what you pay for. Basically a ibis budget hotel but it's clean and comfortable so can't really complain. The value for money is good and it is in good location to the beach, nightlife and shops. There is no outdoor pool which is a shame but it's to be expected as its so cheap ",,"Just had 5 nights at the Radisson. Had a great time. Hotel was beautiful. Really friendly staff.  I think it’s as good if not better than the luxury 5 star hotels in Nusa Dua I.e. Ritz, Sofitel etc. Food is exceptional. We even had an impromptu cooking class from head chef, Jerome. He was incredibly generous. Will be back next year for sure!!"
"We hired an official guide to learn more about the temple and to be harrassed less. Unfortunately, our guide spoke only little english, had little to tell and even asked us to double our tip at the end of the tour, despite having already paid the official fee for both him and…","Very affordable, very relaxing scenery, and the monkeys are very interesting to watch.  Monkeys are for the most part pretty calm but a monkey took my daughter's water bottle and another tried to take my hat so be aware of any loose items.

Not for the type that wants to enjoy genuine culture.,"Even if you know, that you can climb on Mount Batur without guide, they don’t let you go. We wanted go at the morning, at 5am, but they stop us - six guys, not friendly at all, even oposite, I mean agresive guys, and no possibility to pass them. Entrence is 100.000 IDR per…",,"The location is the keypoint. It is located in the heart of Legian. You could go to the beach in a walking distance. There are lots of cafes and bistros around. Not to mention cute boutiques also.  Very recommended if you're looking for a nice, clean comfortable place with affordable price.",,"The hotel is luxury, comfortable, friendly staff, clean and good facility. Also, breakfast is delicious with many options. Moreover, the bed is so comfortable. Especially, for Uluwatu is the best value for 5 stars hotel. I have been in Uluwatu 3 times with my wife but for the next trip I will take my child in Radisson blu hotel, which they have all the facilities for kids and adults "
"To be frank, the temple is stunning and not to be missed when in Bali. What really takes away a lot from the experience is the frequent attempt to rip off tourists. After paying the official entrance fee of Rs.  15000 they stop you at a Bo oth telling that it's not allowed to…","A lovely large area to see gray long tailed monkeys in their most bawse-like habitat. However, nearly got bit by an infant who wanted the sunglasses perched on my head. Fortunately I was able to shake him off without screaming bloody murder, but it did leave me a bit unsettled.","Beach is very crowded, a lot of rubbish, water is for those with decent swimming ability as it is quite choppy. If you are looking to relax, this is the wrong place as every couple of minutes you are asked to buy something new.   Go for the experience, no other reason","I went on the hike today with my sister and it was not at all what I expected but it blew my mind. It is very challenging and rigorous. Also the tour started at 345am so it was pitch black other than a flash light. Our guide, Jay, was incredible. He knew the trail up inside and…",,"Its located near legian and seminyak.. Price was average and they have 3people bedroom (1single and 1double bed) They have spa and restaurant (italian) easy access to walk around kuta and legian..

But overall its great to stay here  Cheers, @balibackpacker",,This hotel is the ultimate relaxation. The moment my friend and I arrived we were relaxed. Checkin was great...our package included so many food drink and massage vouchers which were perfect for the week. Staff were AMAZING. super friendly. Super helpful and funny. A shout out to Arya who worked in Filinis. Totally made our night. So funny and his sense of humour was right up our alley.   The pool staff were incredible. They remembered us every day as did the breakfast people.   The facilities were awesome. Look honestly you can’t go wrong here.   If you go the pasta in filinis is to die for. 
"Biggest temple in Bali placed at a very nice location. But we couldn't enter the main temple due to arrogant locals who didn't allow any tourist to cross the temple entrance unless one hires a ""local guide"" Not worth visiting due to inhospitable people","Such an amazing experience to see monkeys roaming around freely - eating, sleeping playing etc this is a must do atleast once if ever in Ubud ",A very lively beach. Not for solitary strolls or for beach aide activities. Lots of vendors around who constantly call out to you selling hair braiding and Jewellery to beer and coconuts,Such a gorgeous trek!   I did it with a guide and a couple.  I found it easy but the couple in their mid 20s found it extremely difficult and needed to rest every 15 - 20 minutes both on the way up and down!

But on my first morning staying there I was awaken by the strong smell of insect repellent in my room that made me hard to breath and need to went outside the room to breath . I have no idea where it came from and how it got into my room. On the second morning I still got the smell but not as strong as the first morning. It was weird to had that kind of smell in your room.   When I was staying there, they didnt have their own restaurant to provide breakfast and there was no room service that time.

It is really beautiful, tranquil and relaxing. I felt so happy as soon as we arrived - we being my 5 year old son and myself. The staff were accommodating and friendly. The food was good. The gym was great as was the spa. If you want to relax this place is amazing. Fantastic free shuttles services to the temple and the beach. A couple of points to mention - there is NOT a kids club in the traditional sense of the word. There is a kids ROOM. Which I was disappointed about because I had enquired specifically about this before we booked and was told there was a kids club.Babysitters are only $25 AUD for 3 hours.

The temple is really beautiful. The only problem is the locals. They make it difficult if you want to walk around alone. They insist on you having what they call their guides guardians. I went early in the morning 9am and it wasn't so bad. I say if you visit go early morning.…,"Relaxing day inside park. There is many footpaths around, with monkeys on every corner. Take as many pictures as you can, as they don't repeat it. Worth to see. ","Nice beach you can enjoy sunset with couple of bintangs or just surf. Board with instructor about 10 usd, Local beer 3 usd. Massage in nearby SPA 10 usd/ hour.",Mount  and the Lake Batur are famous places of Bali. The view is amazing and there are a lot of tourists. One of the best place to take photos of nice landscape in Bali. Which made our experience even better.,,"Great central stay for arrival/depature in Bali. Clean, good breakfast and spa facility. Only five minute walk to the beach, which was also a great plus during our short stay. Good food just around the corner and just enough distance from the busy nightlife of Jalan Legian.",,"The raddison blu was so beautiful! It was so modern and pretty. It was strange though, because there was heaps of power outages, and I got stuck in the lift without my phone and the lift dropped and was very scary. I was stuck in there for 2 minutes, not long but very scary. It was stunning, but odd neighbours, who were shouting at each other and came into our room looking for me (12 year old) and asking me to stop crying, even though there was no noise. That is not the hotels fault, its just they were probs on drugs or something. The pool was SO PRETTY and so amazing! They had the nicest staff and the nicest restaurants. Thanks rbu."
