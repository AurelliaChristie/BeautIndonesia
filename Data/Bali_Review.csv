All worth it for the stunning sunrise views.","I went to the Aling-Aling Waterfalls with a large group of friends while we were on holiday in Bali. We drove to the falls on motorbikes from Ubud, which took around 2.5-3 hours each way (we were probably slower than average because of our large group size). The drive there from…"
"Our visit to this temple was hassle free and we didn’t experience the hassles that others have reported on TA. Our villa driver took us there and his father-in-law was a temple guide who lived on the street up to the temple and he took us round.

Very informative and well organized","Very lovely beach with nice surf and local vendors selling souvenirs and offering massages. Cold beers are cheap and the sunset is fantastic","Don't let the 2am wakeup call discourage you from doing this...it'll def pay off. Watching three sunrise from the very top is so worth it!","The walk to the waterfall and down all the stairs (no handrail in most places) was a bit challenging for me at my mature age, however I had wonderful help from Uda our guide.   My friend did a small jump into the pool and crossed the river to go up to the top of the waterfall. …"

Cons:  The beach was dirty and contaminated.  We were bombarded by walking vendors all over.  Impossible to sit down and relax. ","Beautiful early morning walk for sunrise delight. A challenging few hours but perfectly achievable if taken at the right pace. Always satisfying at the top! We hired a guide but this was not necessary as we took a packed breakfast with us.

Cheaper that waterbom and my boys and hubby enjoyed it much more"

You have the urge to start collecting all the crap, but its an impossible task for one person.   Its a very sad sight.","After a few late nights with the crew.  We were up at 2am to make the trek up Mt Batur in Bali. This was so inspirational.  Our guide was great and spoke good English.  We weren’t under pressure by other climbers.

"Of all the major temples on the Bali tourist map I feel that Besakih has been changed the least by development and commercialism.  Other than the shop-lined approach to the entrance, and some tastefully done enhancements to the walk up from the ticket office, it feels much the…","My boyfriend and I came here on a rainy day but still has fun. It is a beautiful maintained sanctuary with lots of energetic monkeys. We were able to capture some food photos of the monkeys and enjoyed watching them.

"There are some bad reviews on this temple. We did not have more than a 1 minute walk to the ticket office, but were grabbed straight away as we opened the door. We got a guide who was very good and enjoyed what he had to tell us about the site. The guide did ask for a tip at the…","Becareful in there. Do not bring a knapsack or backpack or any food unless you want a monkey to jump down on you for out of no where and start to unzip your back. I witness it. It is not pretty.

"Spent about 2 hours walking around this temple and it was well worth the trip out to it. We have been to Bali many times but have not seen this temple till now. It was a great morning and a truly beautiful temple. So glad we went.","The place was so nice because the monkeys are free to wander around so they are not wild or they dont hurt the people around the place. It was so nice to have a walk there","We stayed at the Grand Inna Kuta Hotel (loved it!), only just few steps away from the beach.

Their price to get in is steep - 250,000 for one person if you take a guided tour of 3-4 hours. Nice young guide.

However, our driver assured us that the local government reformed their policies to address the general uproar of tourists on social media and review sites like TA.

Please follow all the rules. These monkeys are smart. If you have food they will find it...even if you…","Very dirty and contaminated.   I didn't want to swin because I saw death fish and that is not good.   Even went to Nusa Dua and Seminyak and were also very dirty.  ","Wonderful views, good experience, kind honest people.

Fish is excellent and so testy.","If you are traveling from the Seminyak area, then it’s about a 3-hour drive through the mountains which have great views if it is clear, you will even see monkeys by the side of the road. There is also a Temple by the lakes (Ulun Danu Beratan Temple) which is worth a stop…"
"Really grand and impressive temple. Knowledgeable guide in Bali Hinduism. Saw so many devotees praying and making offerings.

Over crowded though.  Took us around 1.5 hours to get to the top.  Breathtaking views.   Make sure you wear proper hiking boots.  Not cold.  Take snacks as they don’t offer any meals.

"From my side, the ""mother temple"" is one of the real highlight on Bali. It is a very huge and you will have dozens of possibilities to take unique pictures. YOU MUST GO THERE!!!","We arrived around 3 pm and we were the only ones there! So we get the whole place to our selves.

I love how people can jump safely and slide safely in the waterfall. And the local guide so helpful we pay like $10 for the help of local guide! Everyone should go to here! Easy access to waterfall"
"Besakih is about 2 hrs drive from Kuta. Besides being the 1st temple in Bali, the architecture is OK, not too impressed.  It is too much hassle since People there try to find any opportunity they have to rip us off.  Be careful at the Entrance fee booth, count your change after…","Great place to visit take note of the signs informing you of the do's and don't's. Monkeys are cheeky, setting is beautiful , I recommend the south end entrance as its not as busy","Beach area is clean. Its a crowded one - tourists throng on to the beach especially in the morning and evening. Parking for 4W is a problem, as such visitor should opt for a cab which will drop you &/pic-up once you leave.","I was exhausted when i hiked up to the mount. I was gonna give up but i didnt and it pay up. The view was perfect. ","125k IDR per person for the short tour (1.5-2 hours) — totally worth the guide if it’s your first time there.

Too many  people and some time  the local  are a bit pushy  to offer  something to buy or to try....  That's was a good experience aswell. Finally  we moved to another beach was a bit better.   That's experienced beach in Bali. ","Beautiful views of the mountain. Really enjoyed the lunch at the restaurant over looking the mountain. It was  a delicious buffet meal.
