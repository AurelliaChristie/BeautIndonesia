We've been handled by the ranger of Taka Bonerate, They persuade us to try a discovery dive. I'm not pro in swimming, i still wear my life jacket while snorkling, so how could i dive? I said it to one of the rangers, but they were very helpful. They explained to us so patiently, informed us that we can see more beautiful views down there. Then me and my friend did it and it was for free.  Coral & fish are very various, i also saw a giant shell, local people call it with ""KIMA"". It take years to grow, i heard they only grow 2 centimeter in a year. So, I think this kima is very old, maybe hundreds year?

Then the dive site is famous for the nudy branch, sometimes divers will choose to experience a night dive in Taka Bonerate.  I stayed at Tinabo Island.

Yes, most of Indonesian reallyyyyyyy loves chili.   Then, i also went to ""Tarupa Kecil Island"" to meet a local tribe, Bajo. These tribe is very famous, they live nomadically. They only stay at this island maybe 2-3 months then move to other island. When we arrived at Tarupa Kecil Island, our guide climbed the coconut tree and we enjoy the coconut fruit to relieve our thirst. We pay nothing for the coconut but our guide pay it to the local people.   Then i also visit sandbanks, called ""BUNGIN TINABO"". We could see a lot of seagulls in here but when we landed in these area, the seagulls flew away. We took some pictures and others only laid down on the beach.

There were visible signs of coral destroyed through fish bombings!    During out stay, we met with Indonesia sea police patrol officers who have just apprehended fish bombers and loads of explosives.  They also confiscated a boat.  Taka Bonerate is in dire need of help!  The fish bombing has to be stopped and for this the people of Selayar and Indonesian Government need help!

We've been handled by the ranger of Taka Bonerate, They persuade us to try a discovery dive. I'm not pro in swimming, i still wear my life jacket while snorkling, so how could i dive? I said it to one of the rangers, but they were very helpful. They explained to us so patiently, informed us that we can see more beautiful views down there. Then me and my friend did it and it was for free.  Coral & fish are very various, i also saw a giant shell, local people call it with ""KIMA"".

They only stay at this island maybe 2-3 months then move to other island.

Tips:  Be friendly to local people, they will be very happy to explain everything they know about Taka Bonerate. Actually, they only wants you to decide that Taka Bonerate is a good place to visit and maybe one day you will come back to Taka Bonerate for sure. I made a new friend there.

It displays a lot of information about the past condition of Makassar and their tribes. For internatinal tourists, the bilingual explanation would facilitate them to enjoy the museum as well.",The cleanliness of the area is more attention and it is better for street vendors not to disturb visitors. More improved in arrangement and added facilities for residents.,"I did snorkling at Taka Bonerate, it was very beautiful. We've been handled by the ranger of Taka Bonerate, They persuade us to try a discovery dive. I'm not pro in swimming, i still wear my life jacket while snorkling, so how could i dive? I said it to one of the rangers, but they were very helpful. They explained to us so patiently, informed us that we can see more beautiful views down there. Then me and my friend did it and it was for free.  Coral & fish are very various, i also saw a giant shell, local people call it with ""KIMA"". It take years to grow, i heard they only grow 2 centimeter in a year. So, I think this kima is very old, maybe hundreds year? I only bring a standard camera for underwater, But the truth is the underwater view is very amazing. Then the dive site is famous for the nudy branch, sometimes divers will choose to experience a night dive in Taka Bonerate.  I stayed at Tinabo Island. I admit it that the facilities are less enough for the tourist. You should take bath with salt water. If you are a backpacker, you won't be disturbed with this kind of situation. The electricity will be shut down at 12PM. I suggest you to sleep outside in hammock because our room ""nudy branch"" is very small, and the air circulation wasn't good enough. When i arrived there, a new facility was added, such as air condition but only in a large bungalow, and the electricity will be shut down at midnight. So, pointless i think.   Food not very various, mainly you will eat fish everyday. If your are from outside Indonesia, you need to beware of the chili. This is a special chili from Selayar Island, chili is very small but it will burnt your tounge. I bought this chili for my mom in Jakarta after we arrived at Selayar. Yes, most of Indonesian reallyyyyyyy loves chili.   Then, i also went to ""Tarupa Kecil Island"" to meet a local tribe, Bajo. These tribe is very famous, they live nomadically. They only stay at this island maybe 2-3 months then move to other island. When we arrived at Tarupa Kecil Island, our guide climbed the coconut tree and we enjoy the coconut fruit to relieve our thirst. We pay nothing for the coconut but our guide pay it to the local people.   Then i also visit sandbanks, called ""BUNGIN TINABO"". We could see a lot of seagulls in here but when we landed in these area, the seagulls flew away. We took some pictures and others only laid down on the beach.   Tips:  Be friendly to local people, they will be very happy to explain everything they know about Taka Bonerate. Actually, they only wants you to decide that Taka Bonerate is a good place to visit and maybe one day you will come back to Taka Bonerate for sure. I made a new friend there.

We've been handled by the ranger of Taka Bonerate, They persuade us to try a discovery dive. I'm not pro in swimming, i still wear my life jacket while snorkling, so how could i dive? I said it to one of the rangers, but they were very helpful. They explained to us so patiently, informed us that we can see more beautiful views down there. Then me and my friend did it and it was for free.  Coral & fish are very various, i also saw a giant shell, local people call it with ""KIMA"". It take years to grow, i heard they only grow 2 centimeter in a year. So, I think this kima is very old, maybe hundreds year? I only bring a standard camera for underwater, But the truth is the underwater view is very amazing. Then the dive site is famous for the nudy branch, sometimes divers will choose to experience a night dive in Taka Bonerate.  I stayed at Tinabo Island. I admit it that the facilities are less enough for the tourist. You should take bath with salt water. If you are a backpacker, you won't be disturbed with this kind of situation. The electricity will be shut down at 12PM. I suggest you to sleep outside in hammock because our room ""nudy branch"" is very small, and the air circulation wasn't good enough. When i arrived there, a new facility was added, such as air condition but only in a large bungalow, and the electricity will be shut down at midnight. So, pointless i think.   Food not very various, mainly you will eat fish everyday. If your are from outside Indonesia, you need to beware of the chili. This is a special chili from Selayar Island, chili is very small but it will burnt your tounge. I bought this chili for my mom in Jakarta after we arrived at Selayar. Yes, most of Indonesian reallyyyyyyy loves chili.   Then, i also went to ""Tarupa Kecil Island"" to meet a local tribe, Bajo. These tribe is very famous, they live nomadically. They only stay at this island maybe 2-3 months then move to other island. When we arrived at Tarupa Kecil Island, our guide climbed the coconut tree and we enjoy the coconut fruit to relieve our thirst. We pay nothing for the coconut but our guide pay it to the local people.   Then i also visit sandbanks, called ""BUNGIN TINABO"". We could see a lot of seagulls in here but when we landed in these area, the seagulls flew away. We took some pictures and others only laid down on the beach.   Tips:  Be friendly to local people, they will be very happy to explain everything they know about Taka Bonerate. Actually, they only wants you to decide that Taka Bonerate is a good place to visit and maybe one day you will come back to Taka Bonerate for sure. I made a new friend there.
