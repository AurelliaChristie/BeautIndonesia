## Trip Recommendations
This is the main section of **BeautIndonesia** where you can find the recommended destinations in each of the 5 most popular places in Indonesia that you found in the previous section. 

### 1. Route Optimization
The most important thing in any holiday trips is the road-time-saver. Of course, we want to spend shorter time in the road and spend longer time in the destinations. We make it easier for you by providing the route optimization map if you want to spend your entire day hoping from one to other destination places we recommend for you. The starting point is your hotel, so you know which destination is the farest and which one is the nearest from your lodging. We made this feature so you can decide which one is your destination in the first day, second day, and so on.

### 2. Destination Description & Travel Tips
Want to know more about the destinations? Choose one of the destinations and read the descriptions! We guarantee that you will be curious and want to start your trip to Indonesia immediately. Before going any further, don't forget to read some travelling tips in your chosen place so you can relax and enjoy your holiday without dealing with any problems.

### 3. Reviews
We know that nothing can make you be less worry other than knowing how people feel when they went to the destinations we suggested. So, we made a word cloud and sentiment analysis from the people's reviews.

In the word cloud, the size of the words implies how many times they were written in the reviews. Of course you can make your own judgement about the destinations from the words you see in this section. In addition, we also do sentiment analysis of the reviews to see what feelings they showed from the reviews they wrote. We don't favoring any parties, so we guarantee that you see honest reviews that we scraped from TripAdvisor.
